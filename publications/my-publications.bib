  abstract     = {Multivariate imputation using chained equations is a popular algorithm for imputing missing data that entails specifying multivariable models through conditional distributions. Two standard imputation methods for imputing missing continuous variables are parametric imputation using a linear model and predictive mean matching. The default methods for imputing missing categorical variables are parametric imputation using multinomial logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression for imputing nominal and ordinal categorical variables, respectively. There is a paucity of research into the relative computational burden and the quality of statistical inferences when using predictive mean matching versus parametric imputation for imputing missing non-binary categorical variables. We used simulations to compare the performance of predictive mean matching with that of multinomial logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression for imputing categorical variables when the analysis model of scientific interest was a logistic or linear regression model. We varied the sample size (N = 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000), the rate of missing data (5\%–50\% in increments of 5\%), and the number of levels of the categorical variable (3, 4, 5, and 6). In general, the performance of predictive mean matching compared very favorably to that of multinomial or ordinal logistic regression for imputing categorical variables when the analysis model was a logistic or linear regression model. This was true across a range of scenarios defined by sample size and the rate of missing data. Furthermore, the use of predictive mean matching was substantially faster, by a factor of 2–6. In conclusion, predictive mean matching can be used to impute categorical variables. The use of predictive mean matching to impute missing non-binary categorical variables substantially reduces computer processing time when conducting multiple imputation.},

Rubin{\textquoteright}s Rules cannot be used when the result of an analysis in an imputed dataset is not a statistic and its associated standard error, but a test statistic (e.g. Student{\textquoteright}s t-test). While complex methods have been proposed for pooling test statistics across imputed samples, these methods have not been implemented in many popular statistical software packages. The median p-value method has been proposed for pooling test statistics. The statistical significance level of the pooled test statistic is the median of the associated p-values across the imputed samples. We evaluated the performance of this method with nine statistical tests: Student{\textquoteright}s t-test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, Analysis of Variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, the test of significance for Pearson{\textquoteright}s and Spearman{\textquoteright}s correlation coefficient, the Chi-squared test, the test of significance for a regression coefficient from a linear regression and from a logistic regression. For each test, the empirical type I error rate was higher than the advertised rate. The magnitude of inflation increased as the prevalence of missing data increased. The median p-value method should not be used to assess statistical significance across imputed datasets.},

  abstract     = {Background: Identifying children with a high risk of developing future obesity could enable timely targeted prevention strategies. The study{\textquoteright}s objective was to develop prediction models that could detect if young children at very early age, from birth to age six, have an increased risk of being obese in early adolescence. Methods: – We analyzed a subset of data (N = 4,309) from the Generation R study, a population-based prospective cohort study of pregnant women and their children from fetal life to young adulthood in the Netherlands. Parental, household, and birth/child characteristics were considered as predictors. We developed separate models for children at age zero (three months), two, four, and six years that predict obesity at age 10 to 14 years. Per age we fitted an optimal prediction model (full model) and a more practical model with less predictors (restricted model). For the development of the prediction models we used regularized regression models with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty to avoid overfitting. Results: – Parental body mass index (BMI), parental education level, latest child BMI measurements, ethnicity of the child, breakfast consumption, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of the child were included as predictors in all models when considered as candidate predictor. The models for all age groups performed well (lowest area under the curve (AUC) 0.872 for the age 0 restricted model), with the highest performance for the 6-year model (AUC 0.954 and 0.949, full and restricted model). Sensitivity and specificity of models varied between ages with ranges 0.80–0.90 (full model); 0.79–0.89 (restricted model) and 0.80–0.88 (full model); 0.79–0.87 (restricted model). Conclusions: – These obesity prediction models seem promising and could be used as valuable tools for early detection of children at increased risk of being obese at adolescence, even at an early age.},

  abstract     = {Background: To assess the neurodevelopment of children under three years, a multinational team of subject matter experts (SMEs) led by the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED). The measures include (1) a caregiver-reported short form (SF), (2) a directly administered long form (LF), and (3) a caregiver-reported psychosocial form (PF). The feasibility objectives of this study in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the United Republic of Tanzania were to assess (1) the study implementation processes, including translation, training, reliability testing, and scheduling of visits and (2) the comprehensibility, cultural relevance, and acceptability of the GSED measures and the related GSED tablet-based application (app) for data collection for caregivers, children, and assessors. Methods: In preparation for a large-scale validation study, we implemented several procedures to ensure that study processes were feasible during the main data collection and that the GSED was culturally appropriate, including translation and back translation of the GSED measures and country-specific training packages on study measures and procedures. Data were collected from at least 32 child-caregiver dyads, stratified by age and sex, in each country. Two methods of collecting inter-rater reliability data were tested: live in-person versus video-based assessment. Each country planned two participant visits: the first to gain consent, assess eligibility, and begin administration of the caregiver-reported GSED SF, PF, and other study measures and the second to administer the GSED LF directly to the child. Feedback on the implementation processes was evaluated by in-country assessors through focus group discussions (FGDs). Feedback on the comprehensibility, relevance, and acceptability of the GSED measures from caregivers was obtained through exit interviews in addition to the FGD of assessors. Additional cognitive interviews were conducted during administration to ensure comprehension and cultural relevance for several GSED PF items. Results: The translation-back translation process identified items with words and phrases that were either mistranslated or did not have a literal matching translation in the local languages, requiring rewording or rephrasing. Implementation challenges reiterated the need to develop a more comprehensive training module covering GSED administration and other topics, including the consent process, rapport building, techniques for maintaining privacy and preventing distraction, and using didactic and interactive learning modes. Additionally, it suggested some modifications in the order of administration of measures. Assessor/supervisor concurrent scoring of assessments proved to be the most cost-effective and straightforward method for evaluating inter-rater reliability. Administration of measures using the app was considered culturally acceptable and easy to understand by most caregivers and assessors. Some mothers felt anxious about a few GSED LF items assessing motor skills. Additionally, some objects from the GSED LF kit (a set of props to test specific skills and behaviors) were unfamiliar to the children, and hence, it took extra time for them to familiarize themselves with the materials and understand the task. Conclusion: This study generated invaluable information regarding the implementation of the GSED, including where improvements should be made and where the administered measures{\textquoteright} comprehensibility, relevance, and acceptability needed revisions. These results have implications both for the main GSED validation study and the broader assessment of children{\textquoteright}s development in global settings, providing insights into the opportunities and challenges of assessing young children in diverse cultural settings.},

  abstract     = {Conventional prediction models typically emphasize overall trends, often missing the variability in individual responses, which limits their effectiveness for personalized predictions. The People-Like-Me (PLM) methodology was developed to address this issue by employing curve-matching techniques to generate individualized predictions. PLM is a data-driven algorithm that selects similar matching trajectories to estimate the trajectory for an out-of-sample target. In this study, we extend the PLM methods by introducing the Mahalanobis distance as a new metric for selecting matches, allowing for the consideration of correlations between time points in longitudinal data. We assess the performance of this enhanced PLM across various scenarios using clinical growth data from children with cystic fibrosis and simulated datasets. Our analysis compares (i) different match selection strategies, and (ii) PLM predictions with those from linear mixed models (LMM). The results consistently show that Mahalanobis-based PLM outperforms both the standard PLM and LMM. This establishes Mahalanobis-based PLM as a more accurate and flexible method for personalized prediction of longitudinal trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Background: The proliferation of instruments that define instrument-specific metrics impedes progress in comparative assessment across populations. This paper explores a method to extract a common metric from related but different instruments and transform the original measurements into scores with a standard unit of measurement. Methods: Existing data from four assessment instruments of child development, collected from three different samples of children, were used to create “equate clusters” of items that measure the same behaviour in (slightly) different ways. A probability model was formulated to identify best items and groups to serve as anchors linking the instruments, assuming that items in an anchoring or “active” equate cluster are psychometrically equivalent. Quantification and inspection of item characteristic curves were used to resolve which equate clusters should be active. We simulated the impact of various analytic choices. Results: Simulation confirmed the feasibility of creating a common metric from data collected with different instruments from respondent samples with different abilities. The method performed as expected in an application in early childhood development. Conclusions: The use of equate clusters is an intuitive and flexible way to establish a common metric across instruments and facilitates the transformation of measurements obtained to a standardized scale. Standardizing instrument scores to a common metric allows for population-level comparisons on a global scale.},

  abstract     = {Background: Neurodevelopmental trajectories of preterm children may have changed due to changes in care and in society. We aimed to compare neurodevelopmental trajectories in early and moderately late preterm children, measured using the Developmental (D)-score, in two cohorts born 15 years apart. Methods: We included early preterm and moderately late preterm children from two Dutch cohorts (LOLLIPOP, 2002–2003 and ePREM, 2016–2017). ePREM counterparts were matched to LOLLIPOP participants by gestational age and sex. {D-score} trajectories were summarized by a multilevel model with random intercepts and random slopes, and multigroup analyses were used to test if the intercepts and slopes differed across cohorts. Results: We included 1686 preterm children (1071 moderately late preterm, 615 early preterm) from LOLLIPOP, and matched these with 1686 ePREM counterparts. The neurodevelopmental trajectories of the two cohorts were mostly similar. For early preterm children, we found no statistically significant differences. For moderately late preterm children, both the intercept (43.0 vs. 42.3, p < 0.001) and slope (23.5 vs. 23.9, p = 0.002) showed some, but only clinically minor, differences. Conclusion: Developmental trajectories, measured using the {D-score}, in the first four years of life are comparable and stable across a period of 15 years for both early and moderately late preterm children. Impact: Neurodevelopmental trajectories are similar for early and moderately late preterm children born 15 years apart and thus seem quite stable in time. The validated Developmental score visualizes these trajectories based on developmental milestone attainment Because of its stability over time, the Developmental score trajectory may aid clinicians in neurodevelopmental assessment of preterm children as this simplifies monitoring and interpretation, similar to a growth chart.},

  abstract     = {Many longitudinal studies collect data that have irregular observation times, often requiring the application of linear mixed models with time-varying outcomes. This paper presents an alternative that splits the quantitative analysis into two steps. The first step converts irregularly observed data into a set of repeated measures through the broken stick model. The second step estimates the parameters of scientific interest from the repeated measurements at the subject level. The broken stick model approximates each subject{\textquoteright}s trajectory by a series of connected straight lines. The breakpoints, specified by the user, divide the time axis into consecutive intervals common to all subjects. Specification of the model requires just three variables: time, measurement and subject. The model is a special case of the linear mixed model, with time as a linear B-spline and subject as the grouping factor. The main assumptions are: Subjects are exchangeable, trajectories between consecutive breakpoints are straight, random effects follow a multivariate normal distribution, and unobserved data are missing at random. The R package brokenstick v2.5.0 offers tools to calculate, predict, impute and visualize broken stick estimates. The package supports two optimization methods, including options to constrain the variancecovariance matrix of the random effects. We demonstrate six applications of the model: Detection of critical periods, estimation of the time-to-time correlations, profile analysis, curve interpolation, multiple imputation and personalized prediction of future outcomes by curve matching.},

  abstract     = {Intensive longitudinal data can be used to explore important associations and patterns between various types of inputs and outcomes. Nonlinear relations and irregular measurement occasions can pose problems to develop an accurate model for these kinds of data. This paper focuses on the development, fitting and evaluation of a prediction model with irregular intensive longitudinal data. A three-step process for developing a prediction tool for (daily) monitoring and prediction is outlined and illustrated for intensive weight measurements in piglets. Step 1 addresses a nonlinear relation in the data by developing and applying a normalizing transformation. Step 2 addresses the intermittent nature of the time points by aligning the measurement times to a common time grid with a broken-stick model. Step 3 addresses the prediction problem by selecting and evaluating inputs and covariates in the model to obtain accurate predictions. The final model predicts future outcomes accurately, while allowing for nonlinearities between input and output and for different measurement histories of individuals. The methodology described can be used to develop a tool to deal with intensive irregular longitudinal data that uses the available information in an optimal way. The resulting tool demonstrated to perform well for piglet weight prediction and can be adapted to many different applications.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate imputation using chained equations (MICE) is a popular algorithm for imputing missing data that entails specifying multivariate models through conditional distributions. For imputing missing continuous variables, two common imputation methods are the use of parametric imputation using a linear model and predictive mean matching. When imputing missing binary variables, the default approach is parametric imputation using a logistic regression model. In the R implementation of MICE, the use of predictive mean matching can be substantially faster than using logistic regression as the imputation model for missing binary variables. However, there is a paucity of research into the statistical performance of predictive mean matching for imputing missing binary variables. Our objective was to compare the statistical performance of predictive mean matching with that of logistic regression for imputing missing binary variables. Monte Carlo simulations were used to compare the statistical performance of predictive mean matching with that of logistic regression for imputing missing binary outcomes when the analysis model of scientific interest was a multivariable logistic regression model. We varied the size of the analysis samples (N=250, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000) and the prevalence of missing data (5\%–50\% in increments of 5\%). In general, the statistical performance of predictive mean matching was virtually identical to that of logistic regression for imputing missing binary variables when the analysis model was a logistic regression model. This was true across a wide range of scenarios defined by sample size and the prevalence of missing data. In conclusion, predictive mean matching can be used to impute missing binary variables. The use of predictive mean matching to impute missing binary variables can result in a substantial reduction in computer processing time when conducting simulations of multiple imputation.},

  abstract     = {We examined the setting in which a variable that is subject to missingness is used both as an inclusion/exclusion criterion for creating the analytic sample and subsequently as the primary exposure in the analysis model that is of scientific interest. An example is cancer stage, where patients with stage IV cancer are often excluded from the analytic sample, and cancer stage (I to III) is an exposure variable in the analysis model. We considered two analytic strategies. The first strategy, referred to as “exclude-then-impute,” excludes subjects for whom the observed value of the target variable is equal to the specified value and then uses multiple imputation to complete the data in the resultant sample. The second strategy, referred to as “impute-then-exclude,” first uses multiple imputation to complete the data and then excludes subjects based on the observed or filled-in values in the completed samples. Monte Carlo simulations were used to compare five methods (one based on “exclude-then-impute” and four based on “impute-then-exclude”) along with the use of a complete case analysis. We considered both missing completely at random and missing at random missing data mechanisms. We found that an impute-then-exclude strategy using substantive model compatible fully conditional specification tended to have superior performance across 72 different scenarios. We illustrated the application of these methods using empirical data on patients hospitalized with heart failure when heart failure subtype was used for cohort creation (excluding subjects with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) and was also an exposure in the analysis model.},

Aim: We propose and evaluate a new diagnostic method based on posterior predictive checking to diagnose the congeniality of fully conditional imputation models. Our method applies to multiple imputation by chained equations, which is widely used in statistical software. Methods: The proposed method compares the observed data with their replicates generated under the corresponding posterior predictive distributions to diagnose the performance of imputation models. The method applies to various imputation models, including parametric and semi-parametric approaches and continuous and discrete incomplete variables. We studied the validity of the method through simulation and application. Results: The proposed diagnostic method based on posterior predictive checking demonstrates its validity in assessing the performance of imputation models. The method can diagnose the consistency of imputation models with the substantive model and can be applied to a broad range of research contexts. Conclusion: The diagnostic method based on posterior predictive checking provides a valuable tool for researchers who use fully conditional specification to handle missing data. By assessing the performance of imputation models, our method can help researchers improve the accuracy and reliability of their analyzes. Furthermore, our method applies to different imputation models. Hence, it is a versatile and valuable tool for researchers identifying plausible imputation models.},

  abstract     = {Introduction Children{\textquoteright}s early development is affected by caregiving experiences, with lifelong health and wellbeing implications. Governments and civil societies need population-based measures to monitor children{\textquoteright}s early development and ensure that children receive the care needed to thrive. To this end, the WHO developed the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) to measure children{\textquoteright}s early development up to 3 years of age. The GSED includes three measures for population and programmatic level measurement: (1) short form (SF) (caregiver report), (2) long form (LF) (direct administration) and (3) psychosocial form (PF) (caregiver report). The primary aim of this protocol is to validate the GSED SF and LF. Secondary aims are to create preliminary reference scores for the GSED SF and LF, validate an adaptive testing algorithm and assess the feasibility and preliminary validity of the GSED PF. Methods and analysis We will conduct the validation in seven countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, C{\^o}te d{\textquoteright}Ivoire, Pakistan, The Netherlands, People's Republic of China, United Republic of Tanzania), varying in geography, language, culture and income through a 1-year prospective design, combining cross-sectional and longitudinal methods with 1248 children per site, stratified by age and sex. The GSED generates an innovative common metric (Developmental Score: {D-score}) using the Rasch model and a Development for Age Z-score (DAZ). We will evaluate six psychometric properties of the GSED SF and LF: concurrent validity, predictive validity at 6months, convergent and discriminant validity, and test–retest and inter-rater reliability. We will evaluate measurement invariance by comparing differential item functioning and differential test functioning across sites. Ethics and dissemination This study has received ethical approval from the WHO (protocol GSED validation 00458320.04.2020) and approval in each site. Study results will be disseminated through webinars and publications from WHO, international organisations, academic journals and conference proceedings.

  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: With the ratification of the Sustainable Development Goals, there is an increased emphasis on early childhood development (ECD) and well-being. The WHO led Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) project aims to provide population and programmatic level measures of ECD for 0-3 years that are valid, reliable and have psychometrically stable performance across geographical, cultural and language contexts. This paper reports on the creation of two measures: (1) the GSED Short Form (GSED-SF)-a caregiver reported measure for population-evaluation-self-administered with no training required and (2) the GSED Long Form (GSED-LF)-a directly administered/observed measure for programmatic evaluation-administered by a trained professional. METHODS: We selected 807 psychometrically best-performing items using a Rasch measurement model from an ECD measurement databank which comprised 66 075 children assessed on 2211 items from 18 ECD measures in 32 countries. From 766 of these items, in-depth subject matter expert judgements were gathered to inform final item selection. Specifically collected were data on (1) conceptual matches between pairs of items originating from different measures, (2) developmental domain(s) measured by each item and (3) perceptions of feasibility of administration of each item in diverse contexts. Prototypes were finalised through a combination of psychometric performance evaluation and expert consensus to optimally identify items. RESULTS: We created the GSED-SF (139 items) and GSED-LF (157 items) for tablet-based and paper-based assessments, with an optimal set of items that fit the Rasch model, met subject matter expert criteria, avoided conceptual overlap, covered multiple domains of child development and were feasible to implement across diverse settings. CONCLUSIONS: State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative procedures were used to select of theoretically relevant and globally feasible items representing child development for children aged 0-3 years. GSED-SF and GSED-LF will be piloted and validated in children across diverse cultural, demographic, social and language contexts for global use.},

However, the impact of VP/VLBW status on health-related quality of life in adulthood is inconclusive. The objective of this study was to examine associations between VP/VLBW status and preference-based health-related quality-of-life outcomes in early adulthood. Methods: Individual participant data were obtained from five prospective cohorts of individuals born VP/VLBW and controls contributing to the {\textquoteleft}Research on European Children and Adults Born Preterm{\textquoteright} Consortium. The combined dataset included over 2100 adult VP/VLBW survivors with an age range of 18–29 years. The main exposure was defined as birth before 32 weeks{\textquoteright} gestation (VP) and/or birth weight below 1500 g (VLBW). Outcome measures included multi-attribute utility scores generated by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 and the Short Form 6D. Data were analysed using generalised linear mixed models in a one-step approach using fixed-effects and random-effects models. Results: VP/VLBW status was associated with a significant difference in the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 multi-attribute utility score of − 0.06 (95\% confidence interval − 0.08, − 0.04) in comparison to birth at term or at normal birthweight; this was not replicated for the Short Form 6D. Impacted functional domains included vision, ambulation, dexterity and cognition. VP/VLBW status was not associated with poorer emotional or social functioning, or increased pain. Conclusions: VP/VLBW status is associated with lower overall health-related quality of life in early adulthood, particularly in terms of physical and cognitive functioning. Further studies that estimate the effects of VP/VLBW status on health-related quality-of-life outcomes in mid and late adulthood are needed.},

We show and share personal interests and needs, and we are able to strategically adjust size according to social position, with love and hope being prime factors in the regulation of growth. In contrast to Western societies, where body size has been shown to be an important predictor of socioeconomic status, egalitarian societies without formalized hierarchy and material wealth-dependent social status do not appear to similarly integrate body size and social network. Social network structures can be modeled by Monte Carlo simulation. Modeling dominance hierarchies suggests that winner-loser effects play a pivotal role in robust self-organization that transcends the specifics of the individual. Further improvements of the St. Nicolas House analysis using re-sampling/bootstrap techniques yielded encouraging results for exploring dense networks of interacting variables. The {D-score} scale, the Infancy-Childhood-Puberty (ICP) growth model and the SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation (SITAR) technique were presented, as well as customized pediatric growth references, and approaches towards a Digital Rare Disease Growth Chart Library. First attempts with a mobile phone application were presented to investigate the associations between maternal pre-pregnancy overweight, gestational weight gain, and the child{\textquoteright}s future motor development. Clinical contributions included growth patterns of individuals with Silver-Russell syndrome, and treatment burden in children with growth hormone deficiency. Contributions on sports highlighted the fallacy inherent in disregarding the biological maturation status when interpreting physical performance outcomes. The meeting explored the complex influence of nutrition and lifestyle on menarcheal age of Lithuanian girls and emphasized regional trends in height of Austrian recruits. Examples of the psychosocial stress caused by the forced migration of modern Kyrgyz children and Polish children after World War II were presented, as well as the effects of nutritional stress during and after World War I. The session concluded with a discussion of recent trends in gun violence affecting children and adolescents in the United States, and aspects of life history theory using the example of ”Borderline Personality Disorder.” The features of this disorder are consistent with the notion that it reflects a ”fast” life history strategy, with higher levels of allostatic load, higher levels of aggression, and greater exposure to both childhood adversity and chronic stress. The results were discussed in light of evolutionary guided research. In all contributions presented here, written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with institutional Human investigation committee guidelines in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki amended October 2013, after information about the procedures used.},

  abstract     = {Background: Multiple imputation is frequently used to address missing data when conducting statistical analyses. There is a paucity of research into the performance of multiple imputation when the prevalence of missing data is very high. Our objective was to assess the performance of multiple imputation when estimating a logistic regression model when the prevalence of missing data for predictor variables is very high. Methods: Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the performance of multiple imputation when estimating a multivariable logistic regression model. We varied the size of the analysis samples (N = 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 25,000) and the prevalence of missing data (5–95\% in increments of 5\%). Results: In general, multiple imputation performed well across the range of scenarios. The exceptions were in scenarios when the sample size was 500 or 1,000 and the prevalence of missing data was at least 90\%. In these scenarios, the estimated standard errors of the log-odds ratios were very large and did not accurately estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the log-odds ratio. Furthermore, in these settings, estimated confidence intervals tended to be conservative. In all other settings (i.e., sample sizes > 1,000 or when the prevalence of missing data was less than 90\%), then multiple imputation allowed for accurate estimation of a logistic regression model. Conclusions: Multiple imputation can be used in many scenarios with a very high prevalence of missing data.},

  abstract     = {Predictive mean matching (PMM) is an easy-to-use and versatile univariate imputation approach. It is robust against transformations of the incomplete variable and violation of the normal model. However, univariate imputation methods cannot directly preserve multivariate relations in the imputed data. We wish to extend PMM to a multivariate method to produce imputations that are consistent with the knowledge of derived data (e.g., data transformations, interactions, sum restrictions, range restrictions, and polynomials). This paper proposes multivariate predictive mean matching (MPMM), which can impute incomplete variables simultaneously. Instead of the normal linear model, we apply canonical regression analysis to calculate the predicted value used for donor selection. To evaluate the performance of MPMM, we compared it with other imputation approaches under four scenarios: 1) multivariate normal distributed data, 2) linear regression with quadratic terms; 3) linear regression with interaction terms; 4) incomplete data with inequality restrictions. The simulation study shows that with moderate missingness patterns, MPMM provides plausible imputations at the univariate level and preserves relations in the data.},

  abstract     = {Missing data is a common occurrence in clinical research. Missing data occurs when the value of the variables of interest are not measured or recorded for all subjects in the sample. Common approaches to addressing the presence of missing data include complete-case analyses, where subjects with missing data are excluded, and mean-value imputation, where missing values are replaced with the mean value of that variable in those subjects for whom it is not missing. However, in many settings, these approaches can lead to biased estimates of statistics (eg, of regression coefficients) and/or confidence intervals that are artificially narrow. Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular approach for addressing the presence of missing data. With MI, multiple plausible values of a given variable are imputed or filled in for each subject who has missing data for that variable. This results in the creation of multiple completed data sets. Identical statistical analyses are conducted in each of these complete data sets and the results are pooled across complete data sets. We provide an introduction to MI and discuss issues in its implementation, including developing the imputation model, how many imputed data sets to create, and addressing derived variables. We illustrate the application of MI through an analysis of data on patients hospitalised with heart failure. We focus on developing a model to estimate the probability of 1-year mortality in the presence of missing data. Statistical software code for conducting MI in R, SAS, and Stata are provided.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Loss to follow-up is a major challenge for very preterm (VPT) cohorts; attrition is associated with social disadvantage and parents with impaired children may participate less in research. We investigated the impact of loss to follow-up on the estimated prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment in a VPT cohort using different methodological approaches.METHODS: This study includes births < 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) from 4 regions in the UK and Portugal participating in a European birth cohort (N = 1737 survivors). Data on maternal characteristics, pregnancy complications, neonatal outcomes and neighborhood deprivation were collected at baseline. Neurodevelopment was assessed at 2 years of corrected age (CA) using standardized parent-report measures. We applied (1) multiple imputation (MI) and (2) inverse probability weighting (IPW) to estimate the impact of non-response on the prevalence of moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment and assessed violations of the missing at random (MAR) assumption using the delta method.RESULTS: 54.2\% of children were followed-up. Follow-up was less likely when mothers were younger, multiparous, foreign-born, did not breastfeed and came from deprived areas. The prevalence of neurodevelopmental impairment was 18.4\% (95\% confidence interval (CI):15.9-21.1) and increased to 20.4\% (95\%CI: 17.3-23.4) and 20.0\% (95\%CI:16.9-23.1) for MI and IPW models, respectively. Simulating strong violations of MAR (children with impairments being 50\% less likely to be followed-up) raised estimates to 23.6 (95\%CI:20.1-27.1) CONCLUSIONS: In a VPT cohort with high loss to follow-up, correcting for attrition yielded modest increased estimates of neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years CA; estimates were relatively robust to violations of the MAR assumption.},

We used data from 397 patients with TKA to develop the prediction methodology and then tested the predictions in a temporally distinct sample of 202 patients. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test was used to assess physical function. Neighbors-based predictions were generated by estimating an index patient{\textquoteright}s prognosis from the observed recovery data of previous similar patients (a.k.a., the index patient{\textquoteright}s “matches”). Matches were determined by an adaptation of predictive mean matching. Matching characteristics included preoperative TUG time, age, sex and Body Mass Index. The optimal number of matches was determined to be m = 35, based on low bias (− 0.005 standard deviations), accurate coverage (50\% of the realized observations within the 50\% prediction interval), and acceptable precision (the average width of the 50\% prediction interval was 2.33 s). Predictions were well-calibrated in out-of-sample testing. These predictions have the potential to inform care decisions both prior to and following TKA surgery.},

Subsequently, these methods were applied to the data of anesthesia procedures with invasive blood pressure monitoring. Different hypotension measures were calculated (i.e., presence, duration, maximum deviation below threshold, and area under threshold) across different definitions (i.e., thresholds for mean arterial pressure of 50, 60, 65, 70 mmHg). These were then used to estimate the association with postoperative myocardial injury. results: After screening 3,585 papers, the authors included 38 papers that reported artifact filtering methods. The authors applied eight of these methods to the data of 2,988 anesthesia procedures. The occurrence of hypotension (defined with a threshold of 50 mmHg) varied from 24\% with a median filter of seven measurements to 55\% without an artifact filtering method, and between 76 and 90\% with a threshold of 65 mmHg. Standardized odds ratios for presence of hypotension ranged from 1.16 (95\% CI, 1.07 to 1.26) to 1.24 (1.14 to 1.34) when hypotension was defined with a threshold of 50 mmHg. Similar variations in standardized odds ratios were found when applying methods to other hypotension measures and definitions. conclusions: The method of artifact filtering can have substantial effects on estimates of hypotension prevalence. The effect on the association between intraoperative hypotension and postoperative myocardial injury was relatively small. Nevertheless, the authors recommend that researchers carefully consider artifacts handling and report the methodology used.},

  abstract     = {Background: Clinicians and patients lack an evidence-based framework by which to judge individual-level recovery following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery, thus impeding personalized treatment approaches for this elective surgery. Our study aimed to develop and validate a reference chart for monitoring recovery of knee flexion following TKA surgery. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected in routine rehabilitation practice for patients following TKA surgery. Reference charts were constructed using Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape. Various models were compared using the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion, Mean Squared Error in 5-fold cross validation, and centile coverage (i.e. the percent of observed data represented below specified centiles). The performance of the reference chart was then validated against a test set of patients with later surgical dates, by examining the centile coverage and average bias (i.e. difference between observed and predicted values) in the test dataset. Results: A total of 1173 observations from 327 patients were used to develop a reference chart for knee flexion over the first 120 days following TKA. The best fitting model utilized a non-linear time trend, with smoothing splines for median and variance parameters. Additionally, optimization of the number of knots in smoothing splines and power transformation of time improved model fit. The reference chart performed adequately in a test set of 171 patients (377 observations), with accurate centile coverage and minimal average bias (<3 degrees). Conclusion: A reference chart developed with clinically collected data offers a new approach to monitoring knee flexion following TKA.},

  abstract     = {Introduction Early childhood development can be described by an underlying latent construct. Global comparisons of children's development are hindered by the lack of a validated metric that is comparable across cultures and contexts, especially for children under age 3 years. We constructed and validated a new metric, the Developmental Score (D-score), using existing data from 16 longitudinal studies. Methods Studies had item-level developmental assessment data for children 0-48 months and longitudinal outcomes at ages >4-18 years, including measures of IQ and receptive vocabulary. Existing data from 11 low-income, middle-income and high-income countries were merged for >36 000 children. Item mapping produced 95 'equate groups' of same-skill items across 12 different assessment instruments. A statistical model was built using the Rasch model with item difficulties constrained to be equal in a subset of equate groups, linking instruments to a common scale, the D-score, a continuous metric with interval-scale properties. D-score-for-age z-scores (DAZ) were evaluated for discriminant, concurrent and predictive validity to outcomes in middle childhood to adolescence. Results Concurrent validity of DAZ with original instruments was strong (average r=0.71), with few exceptions. In approximately 70\% of data rounds collected across studies, DAZ discriminated between children above/below cut-points for low birth weight (<2500 g) and stunting (-2 SD below median height-for-age). DAZ increased significantly with maternal education in 55\% of data rounds. Predictive correlations of DAZ with outcomes obtained 2-16 years later were generally between 0.20 and 0.40. Correlations equalled or exceeded those obtained with original instruments despite using an average of 55\% fewer items to estimate the D-score. Conclusion The D-score metric enables quantitative comparisons of early childhood development across ages and sets the stage for creating simple, low-cost, global-use instruments to facilitate valid cross-national comparisons of early childhood development.},

Bootstrap and multiple imputation are well-established resampling methods for handling skewed and missing data. However, it is not clear how these techniques should be combined. This paper addresses combining multiple imputation and bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals of the mean difference in outcome for two independent treatment groups. We assessed statistical validity and efficiency of 10 candidate methods and applied these methods to a clinical data set. Single imputation nested in the bootstrap percentile method (with added noise to reflect the uncertainty of the imputation) emerged as the method with the best statistical properties. However, this method can require extensive computation times and the lack of standard software makes this method not accessible for a larger group of researchers. Using a standard unpaired t-test with standard multiple imputation without bootstrap appears to be a robust alternative with acceptable statistical performance for which standard multiple imputation software is available.},

  abstract     = {We investigated how different graphical representations convey the underlying uncertainty distribution in ensemble predictions. In ensemble predictions, a set of forecasts is produced, indicating the range of possible future states. Adopting a use case from life sciences, we asked non-expert participants to compare ensemble predictions of the growth distribution of individual children to that of the normal population. For each individual child, the historical growth data of a set of 20 of its best matching peers was adopted as the ensemble prediction of the child{\textquoteright}s growth curve. The ensemble growth predictions were plotted in seven different graphical formats (an ensemble plot, depicting all 20 forecasts and six summary representations, depicting the peer group mean and standard deviation). These graphs were plotted on a population chart with a given mean and variance. For comparison, we included a representation showing only the initial part of the growth curve without any future predictions. For 3 months old children that were measured at four occasions since birth, participants predicted their length at the age of 2 years. They compared their prediction to either (1) the population mean or to (2) a “normal” population range (the mean ± 2(standard deviation)). Our results show that the interpretation of a given uncertainty visualization depends on its visual characteristics, on the type of estimate required and on the user{\textquoteright}s numeracy. Numeracy correlates negatively with bias (mean response error) magnitude (i.e. people with lower numeracy show larger response bias). Compared to the summary plots that yield a substantial overestimation of probabilities, and the No-prediction representation that results in quite variable predictions, the Ensemble representation consistently shows a lower probability estimation, resulting in the smallest overall response bias. The current results suggest that an Ensemble or “spaghetti plot” representation may be the best choice for communicating the uncertainty in ensemble predictions to non-expert users.},

This study shows that valid inferences can only be obtained if the dataset includes a large number of clusters. In addition, it highlights that heteroscedastic multiple imputation methods provide more accurate inferences than homoscedastic methods, which should be reserved for data with few individuals per cluster.

  abstract     = {Appropriate modeling of human growth is needed to detect and counter poverty, poor health and nutrition, and lack of early stimulation. This presentation highlights three recent societal trends that impact on the statistical methodology of growth models. First, the spread of smartphones removes important barriers on information access for low and middle income countries (LMIC). A second trend is personalization of interventions for individuals. Finally, the impact of peers on growth is likely to be an important factor but has hardly been studied. This paper proposes curve matching as a technology that will help to signal abnormal growth and development in due time, to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for a given child, and thus contribute to reduce the number of children who fail to reach their potential in cognitive development.},

Here we apply curve matching to predict the future growth of a specific child, the target child. The method searches in large datasets of longitudinal growth data for other children who are similar to the target child in terms of factors that influence growth. The observed growth curves of these matched children provide valuable insights into the future growth of the target child. The TNO Groeivoorspeller (TNO Growth Predictor) plots the expected growth of the target child, as well as the uncertainty of the prediction. Curve matching is a general technique that can also be used for other health measures. The key requirement is the availability of relevant longitudinal data on the outcome and its determinants.},

When dealing with missing values, such structures need to be taken into account to prevent underestimation of the intraclass correlation. We evaluate predictive mean matching (PMM) as a multilevel imputation technique and compare it to other imputation approaches for multilevel data. We propose partitioned predictive mean matching (PPMM) as an extension to the PMM algorithm to divide the big data multilevel problem into manageable parts that can be solved by standard predictive mean matching. We show that PPMM can be a very effective imputation approach for large multilevel datasets and that both PPMM and PMM yield plausible inference for continuous, ordered categorical, or even dichotomous multilevel data. We conclude that both the performance of PMM and PPMM is often comparable to dedicated methods for multilevel data.},

  abstract     = {Introduction Lifestyle Triple P is a general parenting intervention which focuses on preventing further excessive weight gain in overweight and obese children. The objective of the current study was to assess the effectiveness of the Lifestyle Triple P intervention in the Netherlands. Method We used a parallel randomized controlled design to test the effectiveness of the intervention. In total, 86 child-parent triads (children 4-8 years old, overweight or obese) were recruited and randomly assigned (allocation ratio 1:1) to the Lifestyle Triple P intervention or the control condition. Parents in the intervention condition received a 14-week intervention consisting of ten 90-minute group sessions and four individual telephone sessions. Primary outcome measure was the children' s body composition (BMI z-scores, waist circumference and skinfolds). The research assistant who performed the measurements was blinded for group assignment. Secondary outcome measures were the children's dietary behavior and physical activity level, parenting practices, parental feeding style, parenting style, and parental self-efficacy. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and 4 months (shortterm) and 12 months (long-term) after baseline. Multilevel multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the effect of the intervention on primary and secondary outcome measures. Results No intervention effects were found on children's body composition. Analyses of secondary outcomes showed positive short-term intervention effects on children's soft-drink consumption and parental responsibility regarding physical activity, encouragement to eat, psychological control, and efficacy and satisfaction with parenting. Longer-term intervention effects were found on parent 's report of children's time spent on sedentary behavior and playing outside, parental monitoring food intake, and responsibility regarding nutrition. Conclusion Although the Lifestyle Triple P intervention showed positive effects on some parent reported child behaviors and parenting measures, no effects were visible on children's body composition or objectively measured physical activity. Several adjustments of the intervention content are recommended, for example including a booster session.},

  abstract     = {Estimation in binary longitudinal data by using generalized estimating equation (GEE) becomes complicated in the presence of missing data because standard GEEs are only valid under the restrictive missing completely at random assumption. Weighted GEE has therefore been proposed to allow the validity of GEE's under the weaker missing at random assumption. Multiple imputation offers an attractive alternative, by which the incomplete data are pre-processed, and afterwards the standard GEE can be applied to the imputed data. Nevertheless, the imputation methodology requires correct specification of the imputation model. Dual imputation method provides a new way to increase the robustness of imputations with respect to model misspecification. The method involves integrating the so-called doubly robust ideas into the imputation model. Focusing on incomplete binary longitudinal data, we combine DIM and GEE (DIM-GEE) and study the relative performance of the new method in a case study of obesity among children, as well as a simulation study.},

  abstract     = {Objective. To develop a short instrument to measure determinants of innovations that may affect its implementation. Design. We pooled the original data from eight empirical studies of the implementation of evidence-based innovations. The studies used a list of 60 potentially relevant determinants based on a systematic review of empirical studies and a Delphi study among implementation experts. Each study used similar methods to measure both the implementation of the innovation and determinants. Missing values in the final data set were replaced by plausible values using multiple imputation. We assessed which determinants predicted completeness of use of the innovation (\% of recommendations applied). In addition, 22 implementation experts were consulted about the results and about implications for designing a short instrument. Setting. Eight innovations introduced in Preventive Child Health Care or schools in the Netherlands. Participants. Doctors, nurses, doctor{\textquoteright}s assistants and teachers; 1977 respondents in total. Results. The initial list of 60 determinants could be reduced to 29. Twenty-one determinants were based on the pooled analysis of the eight studies, seven on the theoretical expectations of the experts consulted and one new determinant was added on the basis of the experts{\textquoteright} practical experience. Conclusions. The instrument is promising and should be further validated. We invite researchers to use and explore the instrument in multiple settings. The instrument describes how each determinant should preferably be measured (questions and response scales). It can be used both before and after the introduction of an innovation to gain an understanding of the critical change objectives.},

  abstract     = {Background and Purpose: Pulmonary problems are among the most frequently reported complications of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. However, the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) is not the same for all patients. The aim of this study was to validate and simplify a previously developed preoperative risk model for postoperative pulmonary complications, particular pneumonia, in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Subjects and Methods: Prospectively collected data for 421 adult patients who had undergone elective CABG surgery, in a university medical center in the Netherlands, were used to validate the preoperative risk model. The model assesses six risk factors (age ≥ 70 years, productive cough, diabetes mellitus, a positive smoking history, predicted inspiratory vital capacity < 75\%, and predicted maximal expiratory pressure < 75\%), with scores ranging from -4 (minimum risk) to 10 points (maximum risk). Patients with a score of -4 to -2 were classified as being at low pulmonary risk and patients with a score of -1 to 10 points were classified as being at high pulmonary risk. The accuracy of the model was tested by comparing the expected and observed incidence of pneumonia for each patient. The prospectively collected data were also used to develop a simple, accurate prognostic model for pneumonia. Results: Of the 421 patients, 227 (53.9\%) were classified as being at high pulmonary risk, 24 (10.6\%) of whom developed pneumonia, whereas only 4 of the 194 (2.1\%) patients classified as being at low pulmonary risk developed pneumonia (OR= 5.62; 95\% CI, 1.91 to 16.48). The area under curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve was 0.84 and the model had a negative predictive value of 97.9\%. Logistic regression analysis showed that the six-factor preoperative risk model could be simplified to a three-factor risk model, containing preoperative productive coughing, diabetes mellitus, and decreased lung function, to distinguish between patients with a high risk of developing pneumonia and those with a low risk (AUC: 0.79; negative 104 Model validation predictive value: 99.2\%). Discussion and Conclusion: The easy-to-use six-factor risk model is accurate in identifying patients at low risk of developing PPCs. Three easy-to-measure preoperative variables (productive cough, diabetes mellitus, and decreased lung function) can be used to help clinicians tailor preoperative and postoperative interventions according to a patient{\textquoteright}s risk. 105},

Research Design: The KIDSCREEN-52, which measures HRQoL in 10 dimensions, was administered to a representative sample of 22,827 children and adolescents (8 to 18 years) in 13 European countries. Psychometric properties were assessed using the Classical Test Theory approach, Rasch analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM). A priori expected associations between KIDSCREEN scales and sociodemographic and health-related factors were examined. Test–retest reliability was assessed in 10 countries. Results: For the overall sample, Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.77 to 0.89. Scaling success (Multitrait Analysis Program) was >97.8% for all dimensions and Rasch analysis item fit (INFITmsq) ranged from 0.80 to 1.27. The intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.77. No sizeable differential item functioning (DIF) was found by age, sex or health status. Four items showed DIF across countries. The specified SEM fitted the data well (root mean square error of approximation: 0.06, comparative fit index: 0.98). Correlation coefficients between Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Child Health and Illness Profile-Adolescent Edition, and Youth Quality of Life Instrument scales and KIDSCREEN dimensions assessing similar constructs were moderate for those (r = 0.44 to 0.61). Statistically significant differences between children with and without physical and mental health problems (Children with Special Health Care Needs screener: d = 0.17 to 0.42, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: d = 0.32 to 0.72) were found in all dimensions. All dimensions showed a gradient according to socioeconomic status. Conclusions: The KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire has acceptable levels of reliability and validity. Further work is needed to assess longitudinal validity and sensitivity to change.}

  abstract     = {The use of the Gibbs sampler with fully conditionally specified models, where the distribution of each variable given the other variables is the starting point, has become a popular method to create imputations in incomplete multivariate data. The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study. }

  abstract     = {The goal of a screening trial is to examine several treatments with the intention of selecting one or more treatment(s) for further testing. Such a trial frequently occurs in the phase II setting, with the intention that the selected treatment be formally compared to a standard treatment in a phase III clinical trial. In this framework it is not essential that the very best treatment is definitely selected (such a decision would require a formal phase III trial), rather it is important that a substantially inferior treatment is not selected when a superior treatment exists. The level of evidence required to select a treatment based on this standard is lower than the evidence required to definitively order treatments. This paper introduces a flexible design for such trials, the flexibility coming from the use of a particular decision rule. The proposed rule states that if the observed difference in the success rates of the treatments is larger than some prespecified quantity d, then the treatment with the highest observed success rate is selected. However, if the observed difference is less than or equal to d, other factors may be considered in the selection. The goal of this design is to mirror clinical practice, where a treatment's success probability is often only one of many considerations in determining a treatment recommendation for a particular patient.
