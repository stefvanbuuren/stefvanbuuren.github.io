This paper presents an alternative that splits the quantitative analysis into two steps. The first step converts irregularly observed data into a set of repeated measures through the broken stick model. The second step estimates the parameters of scientific interest from the repeated measurements at the subject level. The broken stick model approximates each subject’s trajectory by a series of connected straight lines. The breakpoints, specified by the user, divide the time axis into consecutive intervals common to all subjects. We restrict the methodology to just three variables: time, measurement and subject. The model is a special case of the linear mixed model, with time as a linear B-spline and with subject as the grouping factor. The main assumptions are: Subjects are exchangeable, trajectories between two breakpoints are all straight, random effects follow a multivariate normal distribution, and unobserved data are missing at random (MAR). The pkgbrokenstick R package offers tools to calculate, predict, impute and visualise broken stick estimates. The package supports two optimisation methods, including options to constrain the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects. We demonstrate a few applications of the model: detection of critical periods, estimation of the time-to-time correlations, profile analysis, curve interpolation, multiple imputation and personalised prediction of future outcomes by curve matching.","tags":["brokenstick","R","linear mixed model","repeated measures","linear B-spline","personalised estimation","growth curve analysis","critical periods","time-to-time correlation","profile analysis","curve interpolation","multiple imputation","curve matching","two-step method"],"title":"Broken stick model for irregular longitudinal data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Yet erroneous data are stored in the process as well. While this is not interfering with clinical care, research can be affected. Researchers should find ways to remove artifacts. The aim of the present study was to compare different artifact annotation strategies, and to assess if a machine learning algorithm is able to accept or reject individual data points. Non-cardiac procedures requiring invasive blood pressure monitoring were eligible. Two trained research assistants observed procedures live for artifacts. The same procedures were also retrospectively annotated for artifacts by a different person. We compared the different ways of artifact identifications and modelled artifacts with three different learning algorithms (lasso restrictive logistic regression, neural network and support vector machine). In 88 surgical procedures including 5711 blood pressure data points, the live observed incidence of artifacts was 2.1% and the retrospective incidence was 2.2%. Comparing retrospective with live annotation revealed a sensitivity of 0.32 and specificity of 0.98. The performance of the learning algorithms which we applied ranged from poor (kappa 0.053) to moderate (kappa 0.651). Manual identification of artifacts yielded different incidences in different situations, which were not comparable. Artifact detection in physiologic data collected during anesthesia could be automated, but the performance of the learning algorithms in the present study remained moderate. Future research should focus on optimization and finding ways to apply them with minimal manual work. The present study underlines the importance of an explicit definition for artifacts in database research.","tags":["blood pressure","artifact"],"title":"Artifacts annotations in anesthesia blood pressure data by man and machine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.J.

The best fitting model utilized a non-linear time trend, with smoothing splines for median and variance parameters.

These data contain artifacts, which are not relevant in clinical care, but may influence research results. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of different methods of filtering and processing artifacts in anesthesiology data on study findings in order to demonstrate the importance of proper artifact filtering. **Methods**: The authors performed a systematic literature search to identify artifact filtering methods. Subsequently, these methods were applied to the data of anesthesia procedures with invasive blood pressure monitoring. Different hypotension measures were calculated (ie, presence, duration, maximum deviation below threshold, and area under threshold) across different definitions (ie, thresholds for mean arterial pressure of 50, 60, 65, 70 mmHg). These were then used to estimate the association with postoperative myocardial injury. **Results**: After screening 3,585 papers, the authors included 38 papers that reported artifact filtering methods. The authors applied eight of these methods to the data of 2,988 anesthesia procedures. The occurrence of hypotension (defined with a threshold of 50 mmHg) varied from 24% with a median filter of seven measurements to 55% without an artifact filtering method, and between 76 and 90% with a threshold of 65 mmHg. Standardized odds ratios for presence of hypotension ranged from 1.16 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.26) to 1.24 (1.14 to 1.34) when hypotension was defined with a threshold of 50 mmHg. Similar variations in standardized odds ratios were found when applying methods to other hypotension measures and definitions. **Conclusions**: The method of artifact filtering can have substantial effects on estimates of hypotension prevalence. The effect on the association between intraoperative hypotension and postoperative myocardial injury was relatively small. Nevertheless, the authors recommend that researchers carefully consider artifacts handling and report the methodology used.","tags":["blood pressure","child health","artifact"],"title":"Artifact processing methods influence on intraoperative hypotension quantification and outcome effect estimates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

We analyzed the association between pre‐incision blood pressure and patient‐ and anesthesia characteristics, comparing low with normal pre‐incision blood pressure. This association was further explored with a multivariable linear regression. **Results**: In total, 20 962 anesthetic cases were included.

When a new wave of longitudinal data arrives, we can treat the combined data of multiple waves as a new missing data problem and overwrite existing imputations with new values (re-imputation). Alternatively, we may keep the existing imputations, and impute only the new data. We may do either a full multiple imputation (nested) or a single imputation (appended) on the new data per imputed set. This study compares these three strategies by means of simulation. All techniques resulted in valid inference under a monotone missingness pattern. A non-monotone missingness pattern led to biased and non-confidence valid regression coefficients after nested and appended imputation, depending on the correlation structure of the data. Correlations within timepoints must be stronger than correlations between timepoints to obtain valid inference. In an empirical example, the three strategies performed similarly.

In ensemble predictions, a set of forecasts is produced, indicating the range of possible future states. Adopting a use case from life sciences, we asked non-expert participants to compare ensemble predictions of the growth distribution of individual children to that of the normal population. For each individual child, the historical growth data of a set of 20 of its best matching peers was adopted as the ensemble prediction of the child’s growth curve. The ensemble growth predictions were plotted in seven different graphical formats (an ensemble plot, depicting all 20 forecasts and six summary representations, depicting the peer group mean and standard deviation). These graphs were plotted on a population chart with a given mean and variance. For comparison, we included a representation showing only the initial part of the growth curve without any future predictions. For 3 months old children that were measured at four occasions since birth, participants predicted their length at the age of 2 years. They compared their prediction to either (1) the population mean or to (2) a “normal” population range (the mean ±2(standard deviation)). Our results show that the interpretation of a given uncertainty visualization depends on its visual characteristics, on the type of estimate required and on the user’s numeracy. Numeracy correlates negatively with bias (mean response error) magnitude (i.e. people with lower numeracy show larger response bias). Compared to the summary plots that yield a substantial overestimation of probabilities, and the No-prediction representation that results in quite variable predictions, the Ensemble representation consistently shows a lower probability estimation, resulting in the smallest overall response bias. The current results suggest that an Ensemble or “spaghetti plot” representation may be the best choice for communicating the uncertainty in ensemble predictions to non-expert users.","tags":["curve matching"],"title":"Graphical uncertainty representations for ensemble predictions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Gestational weight gain charts for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grade 1, 2, and 3 obese women were derived by the Box-Cox t method using the generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape. **Results**: We observed that gestational weight gain strongly differed per maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index group. The median (interquartile range) gestational weight gain at 40 weeks was 14.2 kg (11.4–17.4) for underweight women, 14.5 kg (11.5–17.7) for normal weight women, 13.9 kg (10.1–17.9) for overweight women, and 11.2 kg (7.0–15.7), 8.7 kg (4.3–13.4) and 6.3 kg (1.9–11.1) for grades 1, 2, and 3 obese women, respectively. The rate of weight gain was lower in the first half than in the second half of pregnancy. No differences in the patterns of weight gain were observed between cohorts or countries. Similar weight gain patterns were observed in mothers without pregnancy complications. **Conclusions**: Gestational weight gain patterns are strongly related to pre-pregnancy body mass index. The derived charts can be used to assess gestational weight gain in etiological research and as a monitoring tool for weight gain during pregnancy in clinical practice.","tags":["gestational age","weight gain","reference chart","BMI","pregnancy"],"title":"Gestational weight gain charts for different body mass index groups for women in Europe, North America, and Oceania","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stef van Buuren"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604650332,"objectID":"cb557f8d2501c1661706edbe1c3fbd4e","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/vanbuuren-2018/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T08:12:12.285672Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vanbuuren-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["missing data","multiple imputation","mice","online book","multilevel imputation"],"title":"Flexible imputation of missing data.

Our objective is to make inference on the association between malaria incidence during the first year of life and height-for-age Z-scores (HAZs). **Methods**: We develop a geostatistical model for HAZs as a function of both measured and unmeasured child-spe- cific and spatial risk factors. We visualize stunting risk in each of the 20 analysed surveys by mapping the predictive probability that HAZ is below −2. Finally, we carry out a meta-analysis by modelling the estimated effects of malaria incidence on HAZ from each DHS as a linear regression on national development indicators from the World Bank. **Results**: A non-spatial univariate linear regression of HAZ on malaria incidence showed a negative association in 18 out of 20 surveys. However, after adjusting for spatial risk factors and controlling for confounding effects, we found a weaker association between HAZ and malaria, with a mix of positive and negative estimates, of which 3 out of 20 are significantly different from zero at the conventional 5% level. The meta-analysis showed that this variation in the estimated effect of malaria incidence on HAZ is significantly associated with the amount of arable land. **Conclusion**: Confounding effects on the association between malaria and stunting vary both by country and over time. Geostatistical analysis provides a useful framework that allows to account for unmeasured spatial confounders. Establishing whether the association between malaria and stunting is causal would require longitudinal follow-up data on individual children.","tags":["child growth","geostatistics","malaria","stunting","low-and middle-income countries"],"title":"Geostatistical modelling of the association between malaria and child growth in Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.M.

In this review, we define indicators of growth, discuss key challenges in their analysis and application, and offer suggestions for indicator selection in clinical research contexts. **Methods**: Critical review of the literature. **Results**: Linear growth is commonly expressed as length-for-age or height-for-age z-score (HAZ) in comparison to normative growth standards. Conditional HAZ corrects for regression to the mean where growth changes relate to previous status. In longitudinal studies, growth can be expressed as ΔHAZ at 2 time points. Multilevel modeling is preferable when more measurements per individual child are available over time. Height velocity z-score reference standards are available for children under the age of 2 years. Adjusting for covariates or confounders (e.g., birth weight, gestational age, sex, parental height, maternal education, socioeconomic status) is recommended in growth analyses. **Conclusion**: The most suitable indicator(s) for linear growth can be selected based on the number of available measurements per child and the child’s age. By following a step-by-step algorithm, growth analyses can be precisely and accurately performed to allow for improved comparability within and between studies.","tags":["stunting","child growth","environmental enteric dysfunction","low-and middle-income countries"],"title":"Practical application of linear growth measurements in clinical research in low-and middle-income countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

Aims: To develop height-for-age charts for contemporary South Asian children aged 0-20 years living in the Netherlands, to evaluate secular trends, and to compare the charts with current Asian Indian, Dutch and WHO references. Subjects and methods: A population-based study measured 3315 South Asian children aged 0-20 years between 2007-2010. Among this cohort, 6876 measurements were taken. Another 7388 measurements were taken of a historical cohort of 1078 children born between 1974-1976 (aged 0-18 years). Results: An upward trend in height was observed for South Asian children living in the Netherlands between 1992-2010. The height-for-age charts of the South Asian historical cohort were similar to current Asian Indian charts. South Asian children in the Netherlands were shorter than their Dutch contemporaries at every age; and these differences increased further during adolescence. Compared to the WHO height-for-age references, there were considerable discrepancies in height, with curves intersecting twice. Conclusion: The discrepancies between the South Asian and Dutch and WHO height-for-age references indicate differences in growth patterns between the source populations.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"Height of South Asian children in the Netherlands aged 0-20 years: secular trends and comparisons with current Asian Indian, Dutch and WHO references.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

We also explored the association between testicular growth and pubic hair development, and data were compared to orchidometric testicular volumes from the 1997 Dutch nationwide growth study. **Results**: The LMS-smoothed reference charts showed that no revision of the definition of normal onset of male puberty – from nine to 14 years of age – was warranted. In healthy boys, the pubic hair stage SD scores corresponded with testicular volume SD scores (r = 0.394). However, testes were relatively small for pubic hair stage in Klinefelter’s syndrome and relatively large in immunoglobulin superfamily member 1 deficiency syndrome. **Conclusion:** The age-corrected SD scores for testicular volume will aid in the diagnosis and follow-up of abnormalities in the timing and progression of male puberty and in research evaluations.

The objective of the current study was to assess the effectiveness of the Lifestyle Triple P intervention in the Netherlands. **Method**: We used a parallel randomized controlled design to test the effectiveness of the intervention. In total, 86 child-parent triads (children 4–8 years old, overweight or obese) were recruited and randomly assigned (allocation ratio 1:1) to the Lifestyle Triple P intervention or the control condition. Parents in the intervention condition received a 14-week intervention consisting of ten 90-minute group sessions and four individual telephone sessions. Primary outcome measure was the children’s body composition (BMI z-scores, waist circumference and skinfolds). The research assistant who performed the measurements was blinded for group assignment. Secondary outcome measures were the children’s dietary behavior and physical activity level, parenting practices, parental feeding style, parenting style, and parental self-efficacy. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and 4 months (short-term) and 12 months (long-term) after baseline. Multilevel multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the effect of the intervention on primary and secondary outcome measures. **Results**: No intervention effects were found on children’s body composition. Analyses of secondary outcomes showed positive short-term intervention effects on children’s soft-drink consumption and parental responsibility regarding physical activity, encouragement to eat, psychological control, and efficacy and satisfaction with parenting. Longer-term intervention effects were found on parent’s report of children’s time spent on sedentary behavior and playing outside, parental monitoring food intake, and responsibility regarding nutrition. **Conclusion**: Although the Lifestyle Triple P intervention showed positive effects on some parent reported child behaviors and parenting measures, no effects were visible on children’s body composition or objectively measured physical activity.

We studied trends in childhood thinness and assessed changes in the BMI distribution since the onset of the obesity epidemic. **Methods**: Growth data from 54 814 children aged 2–18 years of Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan origin living in The Netherlands were used. Anthropometric measurements were performed during nationwide cross-sectional growth studies in 1980 (only Dutch), 1997 and 2009. Prevalence rates of thinness grades I, II and III were calculated according to international cut-offs. BMI distributions for 1980, 1997 and 2009 were compared. **Results**: Since 1980, thinness (all grades combined) reduced significantly from 14.0% to 9.8% in children of Dutch origin, but the proportion of extremely thin children (grade III) remained constant. Thinness in children of Moroccan origin decreased significantly from 8.8% to 6.2% between 1997 and 2009. No significant difference was observed in children of Turkish origin (5.4% in 1997 vs. 5.7% in 2009). Thinness occurred most often in children aged 2–5 years. There were no differences between boys and girls.

Multiple imputation (MI) is a well-known likelihood-based method that has optimal properties in terms of efficiency and consistency if the imputation model is correctly specified. Doubly robust (DR) weighing-based methods protect against misspecification bias if one of the models, but not necessarily both, for the data or the mechanism leading to missing data is correct. We propose a new imputation method that captures the simplicity of MI and protection from the DR method. This method integrates MI and DR to protect against misspecification of the imputation model under a missing at random assumption. Our method avoids analytical complications of missing data particularly in multivariate settings, and is easy to implement in standard statistical packages. Moreover, the proposed method works very well with an intermittent pattern of missingness when other DR methods can not be used. Simulation experiments show that the proposed approach achieves improved performance when one of the models is correct. The method is applied to data from the fireworks disaster study, a randomized clinical trial comparing therapies in disaster-exposed children. We conclude that the new method increases the robustness of imputations.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"Dual imputation model for incomplete longitudinal data.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AA Schuller","Stef van Buuren"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604650329,"objectID":"acad47c1739da0949ee0fb327246d0db","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/schuller-2014/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T08:12:09.664848Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schuller-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Valid estimates of caries experience are needed to monitor oral population health.

Both charts assume the existence of a continuous latent variable, but relate to the observed data in different ways. The D-score diagram summarizes developmental indicators into a single aggregate score measuring global development. The relations between the indicators should be consistent with the Rasch model. If true, the D-score is a measure with interval scale properties, and allows for the calculation of meaningful differences both within and across age. The stage line diagram describes the natural development of ordinal indicators. The method models the transition probabilities between successive stages of the indicator as smoothly varying functions of age. The location of each stage is quantified by the mid-P-value. Both types of diagrams assist in identifying early and delayed development, as well as finding differences in tempo. The relevant techniques are illustrated to track global development during infancy and early childhood (0-2 years) and Tanner pubertal stages (8-21 years).

Subsequently, the scales showed good model fit and reliability, and were examined for key measurement requirements (e.g., category ordening, unidimensionality, and differential item functioning). Finally, calculation and interpretability of scores were addressed. Compared to its previous version, the final IWPQ 1.0 showed improved targeting for two out of three scales.

The resulting configuration of persons shows a remarkable three-dimensional shape that resembles a fountain. The three components explain 13.7, 5.8 and 4.6 percent of the total variation, respectively. Component 1 is driven by age and by the disabilities that come with old age. Component 2 portrays differences in health that are independent of age, with the high scores in relatively good health, given age. Component 3 distinguishes specific types of functional decline from general complaints that impact on daily life. The shape suggests that the elderly keep on maturing as they grow older, actually becoming more diverse as a group. We show how the solution may be used to develop and support profiles for the elderly. Another potential application is to track the individual development of the elderly, thereby objectifying personalized medicine.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"The fountain of age: A remarkable 3D shape that portrays health and functional differences among the European elderly.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P van Dommelen","ML de Kroon","N Cameron","Y Schonbeck","Stef van Buuren"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604650324,"objectID":"f7d01b7a536662783a18941c6cd91f2e","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/van-dommelen-2014-a/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T08:12:03.998049Z","relpermalink":"/publication/van-dommelen-2014-a/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: It is known that height and body mass index (BMI) are correlated in childhood.

The aim of our study is to assess the trend in morbid obesity in The Netherlands among children of Dutch origin since 1980, and among children of Turkish and Moroccan origin since 1997. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional height and weight data of children of Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan origin aged 2-18 years were selected from three national Dutch Growth Studies performed in 1980, 1997 and 2009 (n = 54,814). Extended international (IOTF) cut-offs in childhood were used to define morbid obesity (obesity class II and III combined). The morbidity index for overweight was calculated as the prevalence of morbid obesity divided by the prevalence of overweight. Our study showed that the prevalence of morbid obesity in children of Dutch origin was 0.59% in boys and 0.53% in girls in 2009. Significant upward trends occurred since 1980 and 1997. The prevalence was three to four fold higher in Turkish children compared to Dutch children. The Turkish children also had an upward trend since 1997, but this was only statistically significant in boys. The prevalence of morbid obesity in Moroccan children was two to three fold higher than in Dutch children, but it remained almost stable between 1997 and 2009. The Dutch and Turkish children showed an upward trend in morbidity index for overweight since respectively 1980 and 1997, while the Moroccan children showed a downward trend since 1997. In 2009, children of low educated parents had the highest prevalence rates of morbid obesity; 1.06% in Dutch, 2.11% in Turkish and 1.41% in Moroccan children.

The short-term response variable of GH treatment, first-year height velocity (HV) (cm/year or change in height SDS), can either be compared with GH response charts for diagnosis, age and gender, or with predicted HV based on prediction models. Three types of prediction models have been described: the Kabi International Growth Hormone Study models, the Gothenburg models and the Cologne model. With these models, 50-80% of the variance could be explained. When used prospectively, individualized dosing reduces the variation in growth response in comparison with a fixed dose per body weight. Insulin-like growth factor-I-based dose titration also led to a decrease in the variation. It is uncertain whether adding biochemical, genetic or proteomic markers may improve the accuracy of the prediction. Prediction models may lead to a more evidence-based approach to determine the GH dose regimen and may reduce the drug costs for GH treatment. There is a need for user-friendly software programs to make prediction models easily available in the clinic.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"Personalized approach to growth hormone treatment: clinical use of growth prediction models.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Normative values are presented as reference centiles developed by use of generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape. **RESULTS**: Peak work rate correlated highly with age (r=.915 and r=.811), body mass (r=.870 and r=.850), body height (r=.922 and r=.896), body surface area (r=.906 and r=.885), and fat free mass (r=.930 and r=.902) in boys and girls, respectively. The reference curves demonstrated an almost linear increase in WRpeak with age in boys, even when WRpeak was normalized for body mass. In contrast, absolute WRpeak in girls increased constantly until the age of approximately 13 years, when it started to level off. Peak work rate normalized for body mass in girls showed only a slight increase with age until 14 years of age, when a slight decrease in relative WRpeak was observed. **LIMITATIONS**: The sample may not have been entirely representative of the Dutch population. **CONCLUSIONS**: The present study provides sex- and age-related normative values for SRT performance in terms of both absolute WRpeak and relative WRpeak, thereby facilitating the interpretation of SRT results by clinicians and researchers.","tags":["reference values","steep ramp test"],"title":"The Steep Ramp Test in Dutch Caucasian Children and Adolescents: Age- and Sex-Related Normative Values","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y Schönbeck","H Talma","P van Dommelen","B Bakker","S.

Due to a resulting higher cardiometabolic risk, the BMI cut-offs for overweight and obesity were lowered for adults. For Asian children universal criteria apply. The objectives of this study were to determine the normal BMI distribution and assess the BMI class distribution in a reference cohort of affluent South Asian children born before the obesity epidemic and to assess the influence of the obesity epidemic on the distributions. METHODS: Historical cohort study with 4350 measurements of height and weight of two cohorts (born 1974-1976 and 1991-1993) of Surinamese South Asian children living in The Netherlands, analysed with WHO Child Growth References and International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) BMI cut-offs. RESULTS: The reference cohort 1974-1976 was significantly lighter (BMI Z-score=-0.63; 95% CI -0.69 to -0.58) and more variable (SD=1.19) than WHO reference. Total thinness prevalence was exceptionally high, both in cohort 1974-1976 (WHO 38.3%; IOTF 36.4%) and 1991-1993 (WHO 23.6%; IOTF 23.9%). Overweight and obesity prevalences were low in the reference cohort (WHO respectively 6.0% and 2.1%; IOTF 5.3%, 0.9%), but much higher in cohort 1991-1993 (WHO 13.6%, 9.1%; IOTF 11.7%, 6.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The low mean BMI Z-score and high prevalence of thinness are likely expressions of the characteristic body composition of South Asians. Universal BMI cut-offs should be applied carefully in South Asian populations as thinness prevalence is likely to be overestimated and obesity underestimated. The development of ethnic specific cut-offs is recommended.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"Trends in body mass index distribution and prevalence of thinness, overweight and obesity in two cohorts of Surinamese South Asian children in The Netherlands.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H Talma","Y Schonbeck","P van Dommelen","B Bakker","Stef van Buuren","RA Hirasing"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604650330,"objectID":"c69a11225f9bdc70620146f559734487","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/talma-2013/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T08:12:10.442087Z","relpermalink":"/publication/talma-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"AIM: To assess and compare the secular trend in age at menarche in Dutch girls (1955-2009) and girls from Turkish and Moroccan descent living in the Netherlands (1997-2009). METHODS: Data on growth and maturation were collected in 20,867 children of Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan descent in 2009 by trained health care professionals. Girls, 9 years and older, of Dutch (n = 2138), Turkish (n = 282), and Moroccan (n = 295) descent were asked whether they had experienced their first period. We compared median menarcheal age in 2009 with data from the previous Dutch Nationwide Growth Studies in 1955, 1965, 1980 and 1997. Age specific body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated to assess differences in BMI between pre- and postmenarcheal girls in different age groups. RESULTS: Median age at menarche in Dutch girls, decreased significantly from 13.66 years in 1955 to 13.15 years in 1997 and 13.05 years in 2009. Compared to Dutch girls there is a larger decrease in median age of menarche in girls of Turkish and Moroccan descent between 1997 and 2009. In Turkish girls age at menarche decreased from 12.80 to 12.50 years and in Moroccan girls from 12.90 to 12.60 years. Thirty-three percent of Turkish girls younger than 12 years start menstruating in primary school. BMI-SDS is significantly higher in postmenarcheal girls than in premenarcheal girls irrespective of age. CONCLUSION: There is a continuing secular trend in earlier age at menarche in Dutch girls.

The ‘positive affect’ and ‘somatic arousal’ dimensions cover more specific symptoms. Although the model has met much support, it does not cover all relevant anxiety symptoms and its negative affect dimension is rather unspecific. Therefore, we aimed to extend the tripartite model in order to describe more specific symptom patterns with unidimensional measurement scales. METHOD: 1333 outpatients provided self report data. To develop an extended factor model, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in one part of the data (n=578). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in the second part (n=755), to assess model-fit and comparison with other models. Rasch analyses were done to investigate the unidimensionality of the factors. RESULTS: EFA resulted in a 6-factor model: feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, somatic arousal, anxious apprehension, phobic fear and tension. CFA in the second sample showed that a 6-factor model with a hierarchical common severity factor fits the data better than alternative 1- and 3-factor models. Rasch analyses showed that each of the factors and the total of factors can be regarded as unidimensional measurement scales. LIMITATIONS: The model is based on a restricted symptom-pool: more dimensions are likely to exist. CONCLUSION: The extended tripartite model describes the clinical state of patients more specifically. This is relevant for both clinical practice and research.

Growth depended on the child’s GA. Increase in HC showed an early catch-up and was similar to full-term children by the age of 1. Height, weight, and HC were more variable in boys, particularly in the very preterm children. **Conclusions**: At 0 to 4 years, the growth of preterm children differed from that of full-term children and depended on their GA. The greater variability of growth in boys suggests that they are more vulnerable to the complications of preterm birth that influence growth.

Om sport en bewegen duurzaam te implementeren binnen het mbo is eind 2008 het masterplan bewegen en sport opgesteld door de mbo raad. Dit masterplan sluit nauw aan bij de doelstellingen die zijn geformuleerd binnen het Beleidskader Sport, Bewegen en Onderwijs (SBO) waar het platform SBO uitvoering aan geeft. Het masterplan bewegen en sport binnen het mbo vormt daarom één van de vijf deelprojecten binnen het platform SBO. Het platform SBO heeft als doelstelling dat in 2012 minimaal 50% van de jongeren (4-23 jaar) voldoet aan de beweegnorm (i.e. combinorm). Deze doelstelling geldt ook voor mbo studenten. Om te bepalen of deze doelstelling binnen het mbo is gehaald, is gebruik gemaakt van data die verzameld zijn met Testjeleefstijl.nu (TJL). Dit is een digitale leefstijlscan die mbo scholen o.a. in staat stelt om de leefstijl van mbo studenten te monitoren over de tijd. De data die verzameld zijn in het studiejaar 2009/2010 dienden hierbij als voormeting en de data die verzameld zijn in het studiejaar 2011/2012 dienden als nameting. Met behulp van deze data is onderzocht in hoeverre het beweeggedrag van mbo studenten is veranderd gedurende de periode dat het Masterplan bewegen en sport mbo van kracht was. Hiertoe zijn de veranderingen in kaart gebracht in het percentage mbo studenten dat voldeed aan Nederlandse Norm Gezond Bewegen, (NNGB), de fitnorm en de combinorm. Om te bepalen in hoeverre het beweeggedrag van mbo studenten veranderd is tussen de voor- en nameting is primair gekeken naar de verandering in het percentage mbo studenten dat voldeed aan de combinorm. Tevens is onderzocht in hoeverre er veranderingen optraden in het percentage studenten met overgewicht en obesitas. De verwachting was dat het percentage mbo studenten dat voldoet aan de beweegnorm (i.e. combinorm) zou toenemen in de periode dat het Masterplan van kracht was en dat het percentage studenten met overgewicht en obesitas zou afnemen. Bij de voormeting namen 20 scholen en 7977 studenten actief deel aan TJL. Bij de nameting waren dit 35 scholen en 15349 studenten. Binnen de totale groep van deelnemende mbo studenten daalde het percentage deelnemende mbo studenten dat voldeed aan de NNGB licht van 24 naar 21% en bleef het percentage deelnemers dat voldeed aan de fitnorm en combinorm ongewijzigd tussen de voor- en nameting. Bij zowel de voor- als de nameting voldeed 51% van de respondenten aan de combinorm. Binnen de groep 17-jarige respondenten steeg het percentage studenten dat voldeed aan de fitnorm en combinorm en binnen de groep respondenten van 18 jaar en ouder daalde het percentage studenten dat voldeed aan de NNGB. Daarnaast steeg het percentage deelnemende mbo studenten met overgewicht licht van 14 naar 16%. Het percentage deelnemende mbo studenten met obesitas bleef ongewijzigd. In de periode dat het Masterplan bewegen en sport binnen het mbo van kracht was, is het percentage studenten dat voldoende beweegt in de totale groep TJL deelnemers niet veranderd terwijl de verwachting was dat dit percentage zou toenemen. Desondanks is de doelstelling zoals geformuleerd binnen het Beleidskader Sport, Bewegen en Onderwijs (i.e. minimaal 50% van de studenten haalt de beweegnorm in 2012) gehaald voor de totale groep ondervraagde mbo studenten. De doelstelling is echter niet gehaald voor de mbo studenten beneden de 18 jaar maar het beweeggedrag onder de 17 jarige mbo studenten is wel significant toegenomen tussen 2010 en 2012. Of deze toename het gevolg is van activiteiten die ontplooid zijn in het kader van het Masterplan bewegen en sport binnen het mbo kan niet worden geconcludeerd. Het percentage studenten met overgewicht is tussen 2010 en 2012 toegenomen in plaats van afgenomen en het percentage studenten met obesitas is gelijk gebleven. De activiteiten die zijn uitgevoerd in het kader van met Masterplan hebben dus niet geleid tot de preventie van overgewicht.","tags":["multiple imputation","overweight"],"title":"Rapportage veranderingen in het beweeggedrag van mbo studenten","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

METHODS: Using data from the Dutch nationwide survey performed in 1997 (n = 14,500), we calculated correlations for different ages, and fitted a regression model for the estimation of HC. HC versus height charts were created for different age groups. Data from children from other ethnic groups and children with various growth disorders were plotted on the charts and compared with reference data. RESULTS: Correlations between HC and height or weight showed similar patterns: highest at birth, followed by a rapid decline to a stable level and a peak in adolescence. On charts containing the regression line +/-2 standard deviations for subjects aged 0-2 months and 2 months to 21 years, Turkish and Moroccan children, as well as children with idiopathic short stature and small for gestational age, had a normal HC for height, whereas children with an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor defect or Sotos syndrome showed trends towards a smaller or larger HC for height, respectively. CONCLUSION: HC correlates strongly with height and weight. The charts of HC for height may serve as an additional tool to interpret HC in short or tall children.

The purpose of this study was to examine child and parent background correlates of energy balance-related parenting practices at age 5, as well as the associations of these practices with children’s diet, activity behavior, and body mass index (BMI) development. METHODS: Questionnaire data originated from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study for ages 5 (N = 2026) and 7 (N = 1819). Linear regression analyses were used to examine the association of child and parent background characteristics with parenting practices (i.e., diet- and activity-related restriction, monitoring and stimulation), and to examine the associations between these parenting practices and children’s diet (in terms of energy intake, dietary fiber intake, and added sugar intake) and activity behavior (i.e., physical activity and sedentary time) at age 5, as well as BMI development from age 5 to age 7. Moderation analyses were used to examine whether the associations between the parenting practices and child behavior depended on child characteristics. RESULTS: Several child and parent background characteristics were associated with the parenting practices. Dietary monitoring, stimulation of healthy intake and stimulation of physical activity were associated with desirable energy balance-related behaviors (i.e., dietary intake and/or activity behavior) and desirable BMI development, whereas restriction of sedentary time showed associations with undesirable behaviors and BMI development. Child eating style and weight status, but not child gender or activity style, moderated the associations between parenting practices and behavior. Dietary restriction and monitoring showed weaker, or even undesirable associations for children with a deviant eating style, whereas these practices showed associations with desirable behavior for normal eaters. By contrast, stimulation to eat healthy worked particularly well for children with a deviant eating style or a high BMI. CONCLUSION: Although most energy balance-related parenting practices were associated with desirable behaviors, some practices showed associations with undesirable child behavior and weight outcomes. Only parental stimulation showed desirable associations with regard to both diet and activity behavior. The interaction between parenting and child characteristics in the association with behavior calls for parenting that is tailored to the individual child.

The aim of this study was to review the literature on body size and growth in 0- to 4-year-old children and the association with body size at age 5-13 years. In total, 43 observational studies on body size and/or growth were included, of which 24 studies had been published in 2005 or later. Twenty-one studies considered body size at baseline, and 31 studies considered growth which all included assessment of weight gain. Eight (38%) studies on body size, and 15 (48%) on weight gain were evaluated as high-quality studies. Our results support conclusions in previous reviews of a positive association between body size and weight gain in early childhood, and subsequent body size. Body size at 5-6 months of age and later and weight gain at 0-2 years of age were consistently positively associated with high subsequent body size. Results in this review were mainly based on studies from developed Western countries, but seven studies from developing countries showed similar results to those from developed countries.

METHODS: Forty-nine subjects (21 men and 28 women; age range = 22-62 yr) performed a controlled sequence of activities: sitting, standing, using the stairs, and walking and cycling at two self-paced speeds. All subjects wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on the hip and the ankle. In the ANN models, the following accelerometer signal characteristics were used: 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, absolute deviation, coefficient of variability, and lag-one autocorrelation. RESULTS: The model based on the hip accelerometer data and the model based on the ankle accelerometer data correctly classified the five activities 80.4% and 77.7% of the time, respectively, whereas the model based on the data from both sensors achieved a percentage of 83.0%. The hip model produced a better classification of the activities cycling, using the stairs, and sitting, whereas the ankle model was better able to correctly classify the activities walking and standing still. All three models often misclassified using the stairs and standing still. The accuracy of the models significantly decreased when a distinction was made between regular versus brisk walking or cycling and between going up and going down the stairs. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively simple ANN models perform well in identifying the type but not the speed of the activity of adults from accelerometer data.

METHODS: We fitted a linear spline model to BMI SDS of 762 young Caucasian adults from the Terneuzen Birth Cohort at fixed ages between birth and 18 y. By linear regression analysis, we assessed the increase in explained variance of the adult BMI SDS by adding the BMI SDS at 2 y to the models including the BMI SDS at 4 y, 6 y and both 4 y and 6 y. AO risk was modelled by logistic regression. The internal validity was estimated using bootstrap techniques. Risk models were represented as risk score diagrams by gender for the age intervals 2-4 y and 2-6 y. RESULTS: In addition to the BMI SDS at certain ages, the previous BMI SDS during childhood is positively related to adult weight. Receiver Operating Curves analysis provides insight into sensible cut-offs (AUC varied from 0.76 to 0.83). The sensitivity and specificity for 2-6 y at the cut-off of 0.25 and 0.5 are respectively, 0.76 and 0.74, and 0.36 and 0.93, whereas the PPV is 0.52 and 0.67, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The risk score diagrams can serve as a tool for young children for primary prevention of adult overweight. To avoid wrongly designating children at risk for AO, we propose a cut-off with a high specificity at the risk of approximately 0.5. After external validation, wider adoption of this tool might enhance primary AO prevention.

DESIGN: Nationwide cross-sectional data collection by trained health care professionals. PARTICIPANTS: 10,129 children of Dutch origin aged 0-21 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overweight (including obesity) and obesity prevalences for Dutch children, defined by the cut-off values on body mass index references according to the International Obesity Task Force. RESULTS: In 2009, 12.8% of the Dutch boys and 14.8% of the Dutch girls aged 2-21 years were overweight and 1.8% of the boys and 2.2% of the girls were classified as obese. This is a two to three fold higher prevalence in overweight and four to six fold increase in obesity since 1980. Since 1997, a substantial rise took place, especially in obesity, which increased 1.4 times in girls and doubled in boys. There was no increase in mean BMI SDS in the major cities since 1997. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity prevalences in 2009 were substantially higher than in 1980 and 1997. However, the overweight prevalence stabilized in the major cities. This might be an indication that the rising trend in overweight in the Netherlands is starting to turn.

The aims of our study were to assess the relationship between exclusive BF duration and BMI, waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) at adulthood, and to study whether dietary behaviour could explain the relationship between BF duration and the proxies of fat mass. METHODS: In 2004-2005, 822 subjects from the Terneuzen Birth Cohort (n = 2,604), aged 18-28 years, filled in postal questionnaires including sociodemographic factors and aspects of dietary behaviour (dietary pattern, and consumption of fruit and vegetables, snacks, sweetened beverages and alcohol); 737 subjects also underwent anthropometric measurements of weight, height, and waist and hip circumference. The relationship between exclusive BF duration and dietary outcomes was investigated by logistic regression analysis. The relationships of BF duration with the anthropometric measures were investigated by linear regression analyses. All results were corrected for age, gender and possible confounders. Finally, regression analyses were performed to investigate if diet factors had a mediating effect on the relationship between BF duration and fat mass. RESULTS: A significant inverse dose-response relationship of BF duration was found for BMI (beta-0.13, SE 0.06), WC (beta-0.39, SE 0.18) and WHR (beta-0.003, SE 0.001), after correction for age, gender and confounders. The odds ratio (OR) of exclusive BF duration in months for a breakfast frequency of at least 5 times a week was 1.16 (95%CI 1.06-1.27), and for snack consumption of less than twice a week was 1.15 (95%CI 1.06-1.25). Both ORs were corrected for age, gender and confounders. For other dietary outcomes, the results point in the same direction, i.e. a positive relationship with BF duration, but these were not statistically significant. A mediating effect of the diet factors on the association between BF and anthropometric outcomes was not shown. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive BF duration had a significant inverse dose-response relationship with BMI, WC and WHR at young adulthood. BF duration was positively related to a healthier diet at adulthood, but this did not explain the protective effect of BF against body fat. Our results underline the recommendation of the WHO to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months or longer.

The novel method originates from Rubins potential outcomes framework which explicitly defines that each unit has a possible active treatment and control treatment outcome. Since every unit can only be assigned to one treatment, one of the potential outcomes is unobserved for each unit. To approximate calculating the treatment effect, the unobserved potential outcomes are multiple imputed. To start at the basics of group comparisons, the paper is restricted to completely random groups. The method is evaluated by a series of simulations using a realistic, empirical synthetic population. Overall, the results show that the novel method performs up to standards: bias is negligible compared to the standard error and 95 per cent confidence interval coverage is above 90 per cent. Also, the novel method is more efficient and powerful than the frequently used Student’s t-test when the relation between the covariates and potential outcomes is linear. Multiple imputation of potential outcomes performs approximatly equally well as classical ANCOVA. At a small sample size, the novel method is somewhat more powerful when the assumption of parallel slopes is violated, but it is slightly less efficient than ANCOVA for all used properties of covariates, sample sizes and effect sizes.","tags":["potential outcomes","counterfactuals","ANCOVA","missing data","causal effect"],"title":"A novel method to obtain the treatment effect assessed for a completely randomized design: Multiple imputation of unobserved potential outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

This study examined the relationship between child-care use and BMI z-scores and overweight, as well as associates of child-care use in children up to 2 years old. METHODS: Longitudinal data originated from the Dutch KOALA Birth Cohort Study. Questionnaires assessed child-care use at ages 7 months and 1 and 2 years (N=2396). Height and weight assessed at 1 and 2 years were used to calculate BMI z-scores. Overweight was defined as a BMI z-score of /=85th percentile. The influence of child-care use on weight development was tested using backward linear and logistic regression analyses. Outcomes were: (1) BMI z-score at 1 and 2 years; (2) change in BMI z-score between 1 and 2 years; (3) overweight vs non-overweight at 1 and 2 years; and (4) change from normal weight to overweight vs remaining normal weight between 1 and 2 years. The association between child-care use and parental background characteristics was tested using backward logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Child-care use (no/yes) at 1 and 2 years positively predicted BMI z-scores at age 2 years, as well as change in BMI z-score between 1 and 2 years. These associations were adjusted for various covariates (for example, parental working hours). Furthermore, child-care use significantly increased the odds of being overweight at age 1 year.

The explanation for this phenomenon is not clear. Longitudinal data from the Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child Health Clinics study with a cohort of 2,151 Dutch children were analyzed according to a pattern mixture model. It appears that higher than average growth of EBF infants during the first 2 months is primarily attributable to selective dropout. Furthermore, between months 2 and 6, light nonEBF infants gain more weight than light EBF infants. Both factors aid in explaining differences in growth between EBF and nonEBF infants. The WHO Child Growth Standards for weight-for-age have been calculated from a subgroup of 903 infants (out of 1,743) that complied with strict feeding criteria. If similar dropout mechanisms operate in the Multicentre Growth Reference Study, then the WHO weight-for-age standards are expected to be systematically different from those for the entire group of 1,743 infants.

In particular, the stupendous increase of some 15-19cm in final adult height during the last 150 years in most European countries (the “secular trend”), the concomitant changes in body and head proportions, the tendency towards early onset of sexual maturation, the changes in the age when final height is being reached, and the very recent trend in body mass index, have generated much scientific literature. The marked plasticity of growth in height and weight over time causes problems. Child growth references differ between nations, they tend to quickly become out of date, and raise a number of questions regarding fitting methods, effects caused by selective drop-out, etc. New findings contradict common beliefs about the primary importance of nutritional and health related factors for secular changes in growth. There appears to be a broad age span from mid-childhood to early adolescence that is characterised by a peculiar insusceptibility. Environmental factors that are known to influence growth during this age span appear to have only little or no impact on final height. Major re-arrangements in height occur at an age when puberty has almost been completed and final height has almost been reached, implying that factors, which drive the secular trend in height, are limited to early childhood and late adolescence.

Furthermore, it is recently proposed that chronic LBP needs a prognostic approach to determine who will develop clinically significant back pain. Therefore, it is imperative to identify prognostic factors that are mostly seen in chronic LBP patients at an early stage. This may give clinicians tailored advice to prevent chronicity or may refer to a specific intervention. PURPOSE: To investigate the contribution of demographic, work, clinical, and psychosocial variables, including new prognostic variables as changes in pain intensity and disability status, on the development of chronic LBP. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective cohort data by merging data from three randomized trials (secondary analyses). PATIENT SAMPLE: Workers (n=628) on sick leave because of subacute nonspecific LBP. OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronic LBP for longer than 6 months (functional measure). METHODS: Potential prognostic variables were demographic, work, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics (self-report measures). We also included as prognostic variables a clinically relevant change in pain intensity and disability status. For the selection of variables and prognostic models, bootstrapping techniques were used in combination with multivariable logistic regression. The explained variance and discrimination were used to evaluate the clinical performance of the models. RESULTS: The variables most strongly related to chronic LBP were as follows: no clinically relevant change in pain intensity and in disability status in the first 3 months, a higher pain intensity score at baseline, and a higher score for kinesiophobia. This prognostic model had a bootstrap-corrected explained variance of 37% and a discriminative ability (c index) of 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical-, work-, and psychosocial-related variables contribute to the development of chronic LBP. The most promising variables are a clinically relevant decrease in pain intensity and in disability status in the first 3 months. These variables are relevant for clinicians to advise their patients with respect to preventive measures or treatment strategies.

In most resource poor countries, however, the required anthropometric data from purpose-designed growth surveys are not readily available. We propose a practical method for estimating regional (multi-country) age-conditional weight distributions based on existing survey data from different countries. We developed a two-step method by which one is able to model data with widely different age ranges and sample sizes. The method produces references both at the country level and at the regional (multi-country) level. The first step models country-specific centile curves by Box-Cox t and Box-Cox power exponential distributions implemented in generalized additive model for location, scale and shape through a common model. Individual countries may vary in location and spread. The second step defines the regional reference from a finite mixture of the country distributions, weighted by population size. To demonstrate the method we fitted the weight-for-age distribution of 12 countries in South East Asia and the Western Pacific, based on 273 270 observations. We modeled both the raw body weight and the corresponding Z score, and obtained a good fit between the final models and the original data for both solutions. We briefly discuss an application of the generated regional references to obtain appropriate, region specific, age-based dosing regimens of drugs used in the tropics. The method is an affordable and efficient strategy to estimate regional growth distributions where the standard costly alternatives are not an option.

In most TS girls, puberty is induced with exogenous oestrogens. Objective: To describe the pubertal development and uterine dimensions achieved by low-dose 17β-oestradiol (17β-E2) orally started at an appropriate age. Additionally, to determine whether serum hormone levels aid evaluation of pubertal progression. Design In 56 TS girls, we prospectively studied pubertal stage, serum E2, LH, FSH, SHBG and oestrone (E1), starting oestrogen treat- ment with a low-dose 17β-E2 (5 μg/kg/day) during GH treatment at mean (SD) age 12·7 (0·7) years. Hormone levels were measured at start, 3 months after start and after increasing 17β-E2 dosage. Uterine dimensions were measured in 39 TS women at age 19·9 (2·2) years. Results Althoughbreastandpubichairdevelopmentweresimilar to that in normal Dutch girls up to Tanner stage B5 and P5, respec- tively, breast development was 2 years later. Before oestrogen therapy, E2 levels were comparable to those in prepubertal girls. With a 17β-E2 dose of 5 μg/kg/day, these levels increased significantly, becoming comparable to normal late pubertal or adult concentrations, whereas SHBG levels were unchanged. At the adult 17β-E2 dose, SHBG had increased significantly. Uterus shape was juvenile in four (10·2%), cylin- drical in four and mature-adult shaped in 31 (79·5%) of TS patients. Conclusions During GH treatment in TS girls, normal breast development up to B5 can be mimicked, with just a 2-year delay. In a clinical setting, serum hormone levels provide no additional infor- mation for evaluating pubertal progression. After age-appropriate pubertal induction, uterine dimensions in women aged nearly 20 years were subnormal. It remains unclear whether this was related to E2 dosage, timing or duration, or factors related to TS.","tags":["Tanner stages","puberty plot","Turner syndrome"],"title":"Puberty induction in Turner syndrome: results of oestrogen treatment on development of secondary sexual characteristics, uterine dimensions and serum hormone levels.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

As part of a broad consultative process for selecting the best statistical methods, WHO convened a group of statisticians and child growth experts to review available methods, develop a strategy for assessing their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss methodological issues likely to be faced in the process of constructing the new growth curves. To select the method(s) to be used, the group proposed a two-stage decision-making process. First, to select a few relevant methods based on a list of set criteria and, second, to compare the methods using available tests or other established procedures. The group reviewed 30 methods for attained growth curves. Using the pre-defined criteria, a few were selected combining 􏰋ve distributions and two smoothing techniques. Because the number of selected methods was considered too large to be fully tested, a preliminary study was recommended to evaluate goodness of fit of the distributions. Methods based on distributions with poor performance will be eliminated and the remaining methods fully tested and compared.","tags":["child growth","growth standard","smoothing","World Health Organization","wormplot"],"title":"Construction of the World Health Organization child growth standards: Selection of methods for attained growth curves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stef van Buuren","J.

Setting: Two district hospitals in rural southern Malawi, between March 1993 and July 1994. Outcome variables: Newborn weight, length, Rohrer’s ponderal index. Results: Maternal HIV (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.76 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.98)) and first pregnancy (AOR 1.83 (1.10 to 3.05)) were independently associated with low weight for age. Placental or peripheral parasifaemia at delivery (AOR 1.73 (1.02 to 2.88)) and primigravidae (AOR 2.13 (1.27 to 3.59)) were independently associated with low length for age. Maternal malaria at delivery and primiparity were associated with reduced newborn weight and length but not with disproportionate growth. Maternal HIV infection was associated only with reduced birth weight. The malaria and parity effect occurred throughout gestational weeks 30-40, but the HIV effect primarily after 38 weeks gestation. Conclusion: Fetal growth retardation in weight and length commonly occurs in this highly malarious area and is present from 30 weeks gestation. A maternal HIV effect on fetal weight occurred after 38 weeks gestation","tags":[],"title":"Anthropometry of fetal growth in rural Malawi in relation to maternal malaria and HIV status","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Objective: To describe growth patterns in infants with low and normal birthweight and determine maternal risk factors for infant undernutrition. Methods: Babies born in a rural district of southern Malawi were recruited. An infant cohort was selected on the basis of low or normal birthweight. Weight and length were recorded at birth and at 4-weekly intervals until at 52 weeks after birth. Maternal characteristics at first antenatal attendance and delivery were obtained. Odds ratios in univariate analysis were adjusted for birthweight. Factors included in the multivariate regression included maternal illiteracy, season of birth, maternal iron deficiency and number of infant illness episodes. Results: Low birthweight infants were shorter and lighter throughout infancy than either normal birthweight or international reference values. At 12 months, placental or peripheral malaria at delivery (adjusted odds 1.8; 1.0, 3.1), number of infant illness episodes (AOR = 2.1; 1.2, 3.6) and maternal illiteracy (AOR = 2.7; 1.5, 4.9) were independently associated with low weight for age. Maternal short stature (AOR = 1.8; 1.1. 3.2), male sex (AOR = 2.4; 1.4, 4.1), number of infant illness episodes (AOR = 2.6; 1.5, 4.4), and birth in the rainy season (2.1; 1.2, 3.7) were independently associated with stunting. Placental or peripheral malaria at delivery (AOR = 2.2; 1.1, 4.4) and number of illness episodes (AOR = 2.2; 1.1, 4.5) were independently associated with thinness. Conclusion: Malaria during pregnancy and maternal illiteracy are important maternal characteristics associated with infant undernutrition. Innovative health/literacy strategies are required to address malaria control in pregnancy in order to reduce the magnitude of its effects on infant undernutrition.","tags":[],"title":"Catch-up growth in Malawian babies, a longitudinal study of normal and low birthweight babies born in a malarious endemic area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stef van Buuren","S.

We set up a prospective, observational study to evaluate the nutritional status of children in an intensive care unit from admission up to 6 months after discharge. A secondary aim was identifying patient characteristics that influence the course of the various anthropometric parameters. Methods: The nutritional status of 293 children, 104 preterm neonates, 96 term neonates and 93 older children admitted to our multidisciplinary tertiary pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit was evaluated by anthropometry upon and during admission, at discharge and 6 weeks and 6 months following discharge. Results: Upon admission, 24% of all children appeared to be undernourished. Preterm and term neonates, but not older children, showed a decline in nutritional status during admission. At 6 months after discharge almost all children showed complete recovery of nutritional status. Length of stay and history of disease were the parameters that most adversely affected the nutritional status of preterm and term neonates at discharge and during follow-up. Conclusion: While malnutrition is a major problem in pediatric intensive care units, most children have good long-term outcome in terms of nutritional status after discharge.","tags":["children"],"title":"Malnutrition in critically ill children: From admission to 6 months after discharge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stef van Buuren","D.

Reference curves for all pubertal stages were constructed. The 50th percentile of Tanner breast stage 2 was 10.7 y, and 50% of the boys had reached a testicular volume of 4 mL at 11.5 y of age. Median age at menarche was 13.15 y. The median age at which the various stages of pubertal development were observed has stabilized since 1980. The increase of the age at stage G2 between 1965 and 1997 is probably owing to different interpretations of its definition. The current age limits for the definition of precocious are close to the third percentile of these references. A high agreement was found between the pubic hair stages and stages of pubertal (genital and breast) development, but slightly more in boys than in girls. Menarcheal age was dependent on height, weight, and body mass index. At a given age tall or heavy girls have a higher probability of having menarche compared with short or thin girls. A body weight exceeding 60 kg (+1 SDS), or a body mass index of 20 (+1 SDS), has no or little effect on the chance of having menarche, whereas for height such a ceiling effect was not observed. In conclusion, in The Netherlands the age at onset of puberty or menarche has stabilized since 1980. Height, weight, and body mass index have a strong influence on the chance of menarche.

For diastolic blood pressure crude 5 year all cause mortality decreased from 88% (52/59) (95% confidence interval 79% to 95%) in those with diastolic blood pressures 100 mm Hg. For systolic blood pressure crude 5 year all cause mortality decreased from 85% (95/112) (78% to 91%) in those with systolic pressures 200 mm Hg.

Multiple imputation is a statistically sound technique for handling incomplete data. Two problems should be addressed before the routine application of the technique becomes feasible. First, if imputations are to be appropriate for more than one statistical analysis, they should be generated independently of any scientific models that are to be applied to the data at a later stage. This is done by finding imputations that will extrapolate the structure of the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure. A second problem is to use complete-data methods in an efficient way. The HERMES workstation encapsulates existing statistical packages in a client-server model. It forms a natural and convenient environment for implementing multiple imputation.","tags":["multiple imputation"],"title":"Routine multiple imputation in statistical databases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stef van Buuren","J.

Equality can be used to incorporate prior knowledge about the relations between categories. Categories may belong to the same variable, to different variables, or both. The simplest form of equality specifies that all variables receive identical data transforms. This is useful, for example, if the same variable is measured on many points of time. This article outlines a procedure to deal with unequal category numbers and with subsets of variables. Though the technical results are not difficult to derive, they are not very well-known. Some applications illustrate the method.","tags":["\"\""],"title":"Equality constraints in multiple correspondence analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stef van Buuren","J. L.
