Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem. This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field.","tags":["missing data","multiple imputation","mice","online book"],"title":"Flexible Imputation of Missing Data.

It is unknown if current universal height references are suitable for affluent South Asian children in the Netherlands. Aims: To develop height-for-age charts for contemporary South Asian children aged 0-20 years living in the Netherlands, to evaluate secular trends, and to compare the charts with current Asian Indian, Dutch and WHO references. Subjects and methods: A population-based study measured 3315 South Asian children aged 0-20 years between 2007-2010. Among this cohort, 6876 measurements were taken. Another 7388 measurements were taken of a historical cohort of 1078 children born between 1974-1976 (aged 0-18 years). Results: An upward trend in height was observed for South Asian children living in the Netherlands between 1992-2010. The height-for-age charts of the South Asian historical cohort were similar to current Asian Indian charts. South Asian children in the Netherlands were shorter than their Dutch contemporaries at every age; and these differences increased further during adolescence. Compared to the WHO height-for-age references, there were considerable discrepancies in height, with curves intersecting twice. Conclusion: The discrepancies between the South Asian and Dutch and WHO height-for-age references indicate differences in growth patterns between the source populations.","tags":[],"title":"Height of South Asian children in the Netherlands aged 0-20 years: secular trends and comparisons with current Asian Indian, Dutch and WHO references.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Multiple imputation (MI) is a well-known likelihood-based method that has optimal properties in terms of efficiency and consistency if the imputation model is correctly specified. Doubly robust (DR) weighing-based methods protect against misspecification bias if one of the models, but not necessarily both, for the data or the mechanism leading to missing data is correct. We propose a new imputation method that captures the simplicity of MI and protection from the DR method. This method integrates MI and DR to protect against misspecification of the imputation model under a missing at random assumption. Our method avoids analytical complications of missing data particularly in multivariate settings, and is easy to implement in standard statistical packages. Moreover, the proposed method works very well with an intermittent pattern of missingness when other DR methods can not be used. Simulation experiments show that the proposed approach achieves improved performance when one of the models is correct. The method is applied to data from the fireworks disaster study, a randomized clinical trial comparing therapies in disaster-exposed children. We conclude that the new method increases the robustness of imputations.","tags":[],"title":"Dual imputation model for incomplete longitudinal data.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.A.

Both charts assume the existence of a continuous latent variable, but relate to the observed data in different ways. The *D-score diagram* summarizes developmental indicators into a single aggregate score measuring global development. The relations between the indicators should be consistent with the Rasch model. If true, the D-score is a measure with interval scale properties, and allows for the calculation of meaningful differences both within and across age. The *stage line diagram* describes the natural development of ordinal indicators. The method models the transition probabilities between successive stages of the indicator as smoothly varying functions of age. The location of each stage is quantified by the mid-P-value. Both types of diagrams assist in identifying early and delayed development, as well as finding differences in tempo. The relevant techniques are illustrated to track global development during infancy and early childhood (0-2 years) and Tanner pubertal stages (8-21 years). New reference values for both applications are provided.","tags":["child development","Tanner stages","D-score","stage line diagram","Rasch model"],"title":"Growth charts of human development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Koopmans","CM Bernaards","VH Hildebrandt","S van Buuren","AJ van der Beek","HC de Vet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"0809835b202727c8e4233c76ac9f3e1b","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/2014-01-01_koopmans2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-01-01_koopmans2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ) version 0.2 was developed using Rasch analysis. The goal of the current study was to improve targeting of the IWPQ scales by including additional items. The IWPQ 0.2 (original) and 0.3 (including additional items) were examined using Rasch analysis. Additional items that showed misfit or did not improve targeting were removed from the IWPQ 0.3, resulting in a final IWPQ 1.0. Subsequently, the scales showed good model fit and reliability, and were examined for key measurement requirements (e.g., category ordening, unidimensionality, and differential item functioning). Finally, calculation and interpretability of scores were addressed. Compared to its previous version, the final IWPQ 1.0 showed improved targeting for two out of three scales. As a result, it can more reliably measure workers at all levels of ability, discriminate between workers at a wider range on each scale, and detect changes in individual work performance.","tags":[],"title":"Improving the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire using Rasch analysis.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P. van Dommelen","S. van Buuren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"ed85b88abd55c3fec61b52f4b4917ebb","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/2014-01-01_vandommelen20141/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-01-01_vandommelen20141/","section":"publication","summary":"An important goal of growth monitoring is to identify genetic disorders, diseases or other conditions that manifest themselves through an abnormal growth.

The referral criteria that we discuss are based on either anthropometric measurement(s) at a fixed age using (1) a Centile or a Standard Deviation Score, (2) a Standard Deviation corrected for parental height, (3) a Likelihood Ratio Statistic and (4) an ellipse, or on multiple measurements over time using (5) a growth rate and (6) a growth curve model.

This paper proposes a compact spatial representation of 25 health measurements of European citizens older than 50 years. Data from 44,285 unique individuals were obtained from the EU-wide Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe(SHARE) data collected in 2004-2007 and were analyzed by homogeneity analysis, a form of non-linear principal components analysis. The resulting configuration of persons shows a remarkable three-dimensional shape that resembles a fountain. The three components explain 13.7, 5.8 and 4.6 percent of the total variation, respectively. Component 1 is driven by age and by the disabilities that come with old age. Component 2 portrays differences in health that are independent of age, with the high scores in relatively good health, given age. Component 3 distinguishes specific types of functional decline from general complaints that impact on daily life. The shape suggests that the elderly keep on maturing as they grow older, actually becoming more diverse as a group. We show how the solution may be used to develop and support profiles for the elderly. Another potential application is to track the individual development of the elderly, thereby objectifying personalized medicine.","tags":[],"title":"The fountain of age: A remarkable 3D shape that portrays health and functional differences among the European elderly.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.A.H.

The aim of our study is to assess the trend in morbid obesity in The Netherlands among children of Dutch origin since 1980, and among children of Turkish and Moroccan origin since 1997. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional height and weight data of children of Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan origin aged 2-18 years were selected from three national Dutch Growth Studies performed in 1980, 1997 and 2009 (n = 54,814). Extended international (IOTF) cut-offs in childhood were used to define morbid obesity (obesity class II and III combined). The morbidity index for overweight was calculated as the prevalence of morbid obesity divided by the prevalence of overweight. Our study showed that the prevalence of morbid obesity in children of Dutch origin was 0.59\\% in boys and 0.53\\% in girls in 2009. Significant upward trends occurred since 1980 and 1997. The prevalence was three to four fold higher in Turkish children compared to Dutch children. The Turkish children also had an upward trend since 1997, but this was only statistically significant in boys. The prevalence of morbid obesity in Moroccan children was two to three fold higher than in Dutch children, but it remained almost stable between 1997 and 2009. The Dutch and Turkish children showed an upward trend in morbidity index for overweight since respectively 1980 and 1997, while the Moroccan children showed a downward trend since 1997. In 2009, children of low educated parents had the highest prevalence rates of morbid obesity; 1.06\\% in Dutch, 2.11\\% in Turkish and 1.41\\% in Moroccan children. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: An upward trend of morbid obesity in Dutch and Turkish children in The Netherlands occurred. Monitoring and reducing the prevalence of childhood morbid obesity is of high importance for these children, health care and the community.","tags":[],"title":"Trends in a life threatening condition: morbid obesity in Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan children in the Netherlands.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.H.J.

The short-term response variable of GH treatment, first-year height velocity (HV) (cm/year or change in height SDS), can either be compared with GH response charts for diagnosis, age and gender, or with predicted HV based on prediction models. Three types of prediction models have been described: the Kabi International Growth Hormone Study models, the Gothenburg models and the Cologne model. With these models, 50-80\\% of the variance could be explained. When used prospectively, individualized dosing reduces the variation in growth response in comparison with a fixed dose per body weight. Insulin-like growth factor-I-based dose titration also led to a decrease in the variation. It is uncertain whether adding biochemical, genetic or proteomic markers may improve the accuracy of the prediction. Prediction models may lead to a more evidence-based approach to determine the GH dose regimen and may reduce the drug costs for GH treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to provide sex- and age-related normative values for SRT performance in Dutch white children and adolescents who were healthy and 8 to 19 years old. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, observational study. METHODS: A total of 252 Dutch white children and adolescents, 118 boys (mean age=13.4 years, SD=3.0) and 134 girls (mean age=13.4 years, SD=2.9), performed the SRT (work rate increment of 10, 15, or 20 W.10 s(-1), depending on body height) to voluntary exhaustion to assess peak work rate (WRpeak). Normative values are presented as reference centiles developed by use of generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape. RESULTS: Peak work rate correlated highly with age (r=.915 and r=.811), body mass (r=.870 and r=.850), body height (r=.922 and r=.896), body surface area (r=.906 and r=.885), and fat free mass (r=.930 and r=.902) in boys and girls, respectively. The reference curves demonstrated an almost linear increase in WRpeak with age in boys, even when WRpeak was normalized for body mass. In contrast, absolute WRpeak in girls increased constantly until the age of approximately 13 years, when it started to level off. Peak work rate normalized for body mass in girls showed only a slight increase with age until 14 years of age, when a slight decrease in relative WRpeak was observed. LIMITATIONS: The sample may not have been entirely representative of the Dutch population. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides sex- and age-related normative values for SRT performance in terms of both absolute WRpeak and relative WRpeak, thereby facilitating the interpretation of SRT results by clinicians and researchers.","tags":[],"title":"The Steep Ramp Test in Dutch white children and adolescents: age- and sex-related normative values.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

This study looks at whether this trend in the world’s tallest nation is continuing. We consider the influence of the geographical region, and of the child and parental education, on changes in height. METHODS: We compared the height of young Dutch people aged 0-21 y as determined on the basis of the growth study of 2009, with the height data from growth studies conducted in 1955, 1965, 1980, and 1997. RESULTS: The analysis sample included 5,811 boys and 6,194 girls. Height by age was the same as in 1997. Mean final height was 183.8 cm (SD = 7.1 cm) in boys and 170.7 cm (SD = 6.3 cm) in girls. The educational levels of both children and their parents are positively correlated with mean height. Since 1997, differences between geographical regions have decreased but not vanished, with the northern population being the tallest. CONCLUSION: The world’s tallest population has stopped growing taller after a period of 150 y, the cause of which is unclear. The Dutch may have reached the optimal height distribution. Alternatively, growth-promoting environmental factors may have stabilized in the past decade, preventing the population from attaining its full growth potential.","tags":[],"title":"The world’s tallest nation has stopped growing taller: the height of Dutch children from 1955 to 2009.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.A. de Wilde","S. van Buuren","B.J.

Due to a resulting higher cardiometabolic risk, the BMI cut-offs for overweight and obesity were lowered for adults. For Asian children universal criteria apply. The objectives of this study were to determine the normal BMI distribution and assess the BMI class distribution in a reference cohort of affluent South Asian children born before the obesity epidemic and to assess the influence of the obesity epidemic on the distributions. METHODS: Historical cohort study with 4350 measurements of height and weight of two cohorts (born 1974-1976 and 1991-1993) of Surinamese South Asian children living in The Netherlands, analysed with WHO Child Growth References and International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) BMI cut-offs. RESULTS: The reference cohort 1974-1976 was significantly lighter (BMI Z-score=-0.63; 95\\% CI -0.69 to -0.58) and more variable (SD=1.19) than WHO reference. Total thinness prevalence was exceptionally high, both in cohort 1974-1976 (WHO 38.3\\%; IOTF 36.4\\%) and 1991-1993 (WHO 23.6\\%; IOTF 23.9\\%). Overweight and obesity prevalences were low in the reference cohort (WHO respectively 6.0\\% and 2.1\\%; IOTF 5.3\\%, 0.9\\%), but much higher in cohort 1991-1993 (WHO 13.6\\%, 9.1\\%; IOTF 11.7\\%, 6.0\\%). CONCLUSIONS: The low mean BMI Z-score and high prevalence of thinness are likely expressions of the characteristic body composition of South Asians. Universal BMI cut-offs should be applied carefully in South Asian populations as thinness prevalence is likely to be overestimated and obesity underestimated. The development of ethnic specific cut-offs is recommended.","tags":[],"title":"Trends in body mass index distribution and prevalence of thinness, overweight and obesity in two cohorts of Surinamese South Asian children in The Netherlands.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

METHODS: Data on growth and maturation were collected in 20,867 children of Dutch, Turkish and Moroccan descent in 2009 by trained health care professionals. Girls, 9 years and older, of Dutch (n = 2138), Turkish (n = 282), and Moroccan (n = 295) descent were asked whether they had experienced their first period. We compared median menarcheal age in 2009 with data from the previous Dutch Nationwide Growth Studies in 1955, 1965, 1980 and 1997. Age specific body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated to assess differences in BMI between pre- and postmenarcheal girls in different age groups. RESULTS: Median age at menarche in Dutch girls, decreased significantly from 13.66 years in 1955 to 13.15 years in 1997 and 13.05 years in 2009. Compared to Dutch girls there is a larger decrease in median age of menarche in girls of Turkish and Moroccan descent between 1997 and 2009. In Turkish girls age at menarche decreased from 12.80 to 12.50 years and in Moroccan girls from 12.90 to 12.60 years. Thirty-three percent of Turkish girls younger than 12 years start menstruating in primary school. BMI-SDS is significantly higher in postmenarcheal girls than in premenarcheal girls irrespective of age. CONCLUSION: There is a continuing secular trend in earlier age at menarche in Dutch girls. An even faster decrease in age at menarche is observed in girls of Turkish and Moroccan descent in the Netherlands.","tags":[],"title":"Trends in menarcheal age between 1955 and 2009 in the Netherlands.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S. van Buuren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"e9cb8129df97c501c800b7a8a20ad428","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/2013-01-01_auxology2013/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-01-01_auxology2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Various contributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P. van Dommelen","Y.

The ‘positive affect’ and ‘somatic arousal’ dimensions cover more specific symptoms. Although the model has met much support, it does not cover all relevant anxiety symptoms and its negative affect dimension is rather unspecific. Therefore, we aimed to extend the tripartite model in order to describe more specific symptom patterns with unidimensional measurement scales. METHOD: 1333 outpatients provided self report data. To develop an extended factor model, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in one part of the data (n=578). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in the second part (n=755), to assess model-fit and comparison with other models. Rasch analyses were done to investigate the unidimensionality of the factors. RESULTS: EFA resulted in a 6-factor model: feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, somatic arousal, anxious apprehension, phobic fear and tension. CFA in the second sample showed that a 6-factor model with a hierarchical common severity factor fits the data better than alternative 1- and 3-factor models. Rasch analyses showed that each of the factors and the total of factors can be regarded as unidimensional measurement scales. LIMITATIONS: The model is based on a restricted symptom-pool: more dimensions are likely to exist. CONCLUSION: The extended tripartite model describes the clinical state of patients more specifically. This is relevant for both clinical practice and research.

METHODS: Using data from the Dutch nationwide survey performed in 1997 (n = 14,500), we calculated correlations for different ages, and fitted a regression model for the estimation of HC. HC versus height charts were created for different age groups. Data from children from other ethnic groups and children with various growth disorders were plotted on the charts and compared with reference data. RESULTS: Correlations between HC and height or weight showed similar patterns: highest at birth, followed by a rapid decline to a stable level and a peak in adolescence. On charts containing the regression line +/-2 standard deviations for subjects aged 0-2 months and 2 months to 21 years, Turkish and Moroccan children, as well as children with idiopathic short stature and small for gestational age, had a normal HC for height, whereas children with an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor defect or Sotos syndrome showed trends towards a smaller or larger HC for height, respectively. CONCLUSION: HC correlates strongly with height and weight. The charts of HC for height may serve as an additional tool to interpret HC in short or tall children.

The purpose of this study was to examine child and parent background correlates of energy balance-related parenting practices at age 5, as well as the associations of these practices with children’s diet, activity behavior, and body mass index (BMI) development. METHODS: Questionnaire data originated from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study for ages 5 (N = 2026) and 7 (N = 1819). Linear regression analyses were used to examine the association of child and parent background characteristics with parenting practices (i.e., diet- and activity-related restriction, monitoring and stimulation), and to examine the associations between these parenting practices and children’s diet (in terms of energy intake, dietary fiber intake, and added sugar intake) and activity behavior (i.e., physical activity and sedentary time) at age 5, as well as BMI development from age 5 to age 7. Moderation analyses were used to examine whether the associations between the parenting practices and child behavior depended on child characteristics. RESULTS: Several child and parent background characteristics were associated with the parenting practices. Dietary monitoring, stimulation of healthy intake and stimulation of physical activity were associated with desirable energy balance-related behaviors (i.e., dietary intake and/or activity behavior) and desirable BMI development, whereas restriction of sedentary time showed associations with undesirable behaviors and BMI development. Child eating style and weight status, but not child gender or activity style, moderated the associations between parenting practices and behavior. Dietary restriction and monitoring showed weaker, or even undesirable associations for children with a deviant eating style, whereas these practices showed associations with desirable behavior for normal eaters. By contrast, stimulation to eat healthy worked particularly well for children with a deviant eating style or a high BMI. CONCLUSION: Although most energy balance-related parenting practices were associated with desirable behaviors, some practices showed associations with undesirable child behavior and weight outcomes. Only parental stimulation showed desirable associations with regard to both diet and activity behavior. The interaction between parenting and child characteristics in the association with behavior calls for parenting that is tailored to the individual child.

The aim of this study was to review the literature on body size and growth in 0- to 4-year-old children and the association with body size at age 5-13 years. In total, 43 observational studies on body size and/or growth were included, of which 24 studies had been published in 2005 or later. Twenty-one studies considered body size at baseline, and 31 studies considered growth which all included assessment of weight gain. Eight (38\\%) studies on body size, and 15 (48\\%) on weight gain were evaluated as high-quality studies. Our results support conclusions in previous reviews of a positive association between body size and weight gain in early childhood, and subsequent body size. Body size at 5-6 months of age and later and weight gain at 0-2 years of age were consistently positively associated with high subsequent body size. Results in this review were mainly based on studies from developed Western countries, but seven studies from developing countries showed similar results to those from developed countries.

METHODS: Forty-nine subjects (21 men and 28 women; age range = 22-62 yr) performed a controlled sequence of activities: sitting, standing, using the stairs, and walking and cycling at two self-paced speeds. All subjects wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on the hip and the ankle. In the ANN models, the following accelerometer signal characteristics were used: 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, absolute deviation, coefficient of variability, and lag-one autocorrelation. RESULTS: The model based on the hip accelerometer data and the model based on the ankle accelerometer data correctly classified the five activities 80.4\\% and 77.7\\% of the time, respectively, whereas the model based on the data from both sensors achieved a percentage of 83.0\\%. The hip model produced a better classification of the activities cycling, using the stairs, and sitting, whereas the ankle model was better able to correctly classify the activities walking and standing still. All three models often misclassified using the stairs and standing still. The accuracy of the models significantly decreased when a distinction was made between regular versus brisk walking or cycling and between going up and going down the stairs. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively simple ANN models perform well in identifying the type but not the speed of the activity of adults from accelerometer data.

METHODS: We fitted a linear spline model to BMI SDS of 762 young Caucasian adults from the Terneuzen Birth Cohort at fixed ages between birth and 18 y. By linear regression analysis, we assessed the increase in explained variance of the adult BMI SDS by adding the BMI SDS at 2 y to the models including the BMI SDS at 4 y, 6 y and both 4 y and 6 y. AO risk was modelled by logistic regression. The internal validity was estimated using bootstrap techniques. Risk models were represented as risk score diagrams by gender for the age intervals 2-4 y and 2-6 y. RESULTS: In addition to the BMI SDS at certain ages, the previous BMI SDS during childhood is positively related to adult weight. Receiver Operating Curves analysis provides insight into sensible cut-offs (AUC varied from 0.76 to 0.83). The sensitivity and specificity for 2-6 y at the cut-off of 0.25 and 0.5 are respectively, 0.76 and 0.74, and 0.36 and 0.93, whereas the PPV is 0.52 and 0.67, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The risk score diagrams can serve as a tool for young children for primary prevention of adult overweight. To avoid wrongly designating children at risk for AO, we propose a cut-off with a high specificity at the risk of approximately 0.5. After external validation, wider adoption of this tool might enhance primary AO prevention.

DESIGN: Nationwide cross-sectional data collection by trained health care professionals. PARTICIPANTS: 10,129 children of Dutch origin aged 0-21 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overweight (including obesity) and obesity prevalences for Dutch children, defined by the cut-off values on body mass index references according to the International Obesity Task Force. RESULTS: In 2009, 12.8\\% of the Dutch boys and 14.8\\% of the Dutch girls aged 2-21 years were overweight and 1.8\\% of the boys and 2.2\\% of the girls were classified as obese. This is a two to three fold higher prevalence in overweight and four to six fold increase in obesity since 1980. Since 1997, a substantial rise took place, especially in obesity, which increased 1.4 times in girls and doubled in boys. There was no increase in mean BMI SDS in the major cities since 1997. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity prevalences in 2009 were substantially higher than in 1980 and 1997. However, the overweight prevalence stabilized in the major cities. This might be an indication that the rising trend in overweight in the Netherlands is starting to turn.

The aims of our study were to assess the relationship between exclusive BF duration and BMI, waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) at adulthood, and to study whether dietary behaviour could explain the relationship between BF duration and the proxies of fat mass. METHODS: In 2004-2005, 822 subjects from the Terneuzen Birth Cohort (n = 2,604), aged 18-28 years, filled in postal questionnaires including sociodemographic factors and aspects of dietary behaviour (dietary pattern, and consumption of fruit and vegetables, snacks, sweetened beverages and alcohol); 737 subjects also underwent anthropometric measurements of weight, height, and waist and hip circumference. The relationship between exclusive BF duration and dietary outcomes was investigated by logistic regression analysis. The relationships of BF duration with the anthropometric measures were investigated by linear regression analyses. All results were corrected for age, gender and possible confounders. Finally, regression analyses were performed to investigate if diet factors had a mediating effect on the relationship between BF duration and fat mass. RESULTS: A significant inverse dose-response relationship of BF duration was found for BMI (beta-0.13, SE 0.06), WC (beta-0.39, SE 0.18) and WHR (beta-0.003, SE 0.001), after correction for age, gender and confounders. The odds ratio (OR) of exclusive BF duration in months for a breakfast frequency of at least 5 times a week was 1.16 (95\\%CI 1.06-1.27), and for snack consumption of less than twice a week was 1.15 (95\\%CI 1.06-1.25). Both ORs were corrected for age, gender and confounders. For other dietary outcomes, the results point in the same direction, i.e. a positive relationship with BF duration, but these were not statistically significant. A mediating effect of the diet factors on the association between BF and anthropometric outcomes was not shown. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive BF duration had a significant inverse dose-response relationship with BMI, WC and WHR at young adulthood. BF duration was positively related to a healthier diet at adulthood, but this did not explain the protective effect of BF against body fat. Our results underline the recommendation of the WHO to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months or longer.

This study examined the relationship between child-care use and BMI z-scores and overweight, as well as associates of child-care use in children up to 2 years old. METHODS: Longitudinal data originated from the Dutch KOALA Birth Cohort Study. Questionnaires assessed child-care use at ages 7 months and 1 and 2 years (N=2396). Height and weight assessed at 1 and 2 years were used to calculate BMI z-scores. Overweight was defined as a BMI z-score of /=85th percentile. The influence of child-care use on weight development was tested using backward linear and logistic regression analyses. Outcomes were: (1) BMI z-score at 1 and 2 years; (2) change in BMI z-score between 1 and 2 years; (3) overweight vs non-overweight at 1 and 2 years; and (4) change from normal weight to overweight vs remaining normal weight between 1 and 2 years. The association between child-care use and parental background characteristics was tested using backward logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Child-care use (no/yes) at 1 and 2 years positively predicted BMI z-scores at age 2 years, as well as change in BMI z-score between 1 and 2 years. These associations were adjusted for various covariates (for example, parental working hours). Furthermore, child-care use significantly increased the odds of being overweight at age 1 year. There were few differences in BMI or overweight between intensive (16 h per week) and limited child-care use (","tags":[],"title":"Child-care use and the association with body mass index and overweight in children from 7 months to 2 years of age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S. van Buuren"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"b86b85fe11aeec18dfdbdcb2ec62af9e","permalink":"https://stefvanbuuren.name/publication/2010-01-01_vanbuuren2010a/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010-01-01_vanbuuren2010a/","section":"publication","summary":"Exclusively breastfed (EBF) infants have higher weight gain during the first 2 months, and lower thereafter. The explanation for this phenomenon is not clear. Longitudinal data from the Social Medical Survey of Children Attending Child Health Clinics study with a cohort of 2,151 Dutch children were analyzed according to a pattern mixture model. It appears that higher than average growth of EBF infants during the first 2 months is primarily attributable to selective dropout. Furthermore, between months 2 and 6, light nonEBF infants gain more weight than light EBF infants. Both factors aid in explaining differences in growth between EBF and nonEBF infants. The WHO Child Growth Standards for weight-for-age have been calculated from a subgroup of 903 infants (out of 1,743) that complied with strict feeding criteria. If similar dropout mechanisms operate in the Multicentre Growth Reference Study, then the WHO weight-for-age standards are expected to be systematically different from those for the entire group of 1,743 infants.

In particular, the stupendous increase of some 15-19cm in final adult height during the last 150 years in most European countries (the “secular trend”), the concomitant changes in body and head proportions, the tendency towards early onset of sexual maturation, the changes in the age when final height is being reached, and the very recent trend in body mass index, have generated much scientific literature. The marked plasticity of growth in height and weight over time causes problems. Child growth references differ between nations, they tend to quickly become out of date, and raise a number of questions regarding fitting methods, effects caused by selective drop-out, etc. New findings contradict common beliefs about the primary importance of nutritional and health related factors for secular changes in growth. There appears to be a broad age span from mid-childhood to early adolescence that is characterised by a peculiar insusceptibility. Environmental factors that are known to influence growth during this age span appear to have only little or no impact on final height. Major re-arrangements in height occur at an age when puberty has almost been completed and final height has almost been reached, implying that factors, which drive the secular trend in height, are limited to early childhood and late adolescence.

Furthermore, it is recently proposed that chronic LBP needs a prognostic approach to determine who will develop clinically significant back pain. Therefore, it is imperative to identify prognostic factors that are mostly seen in chronic LBP patients at an early stage. This may give clinicians tailored advice to prevent chronicity or may refer to a specific intervention. PURPOSE: To investigate the contribution of demographic, work, clinical, and psychosocial variables, including new prognostic variables as changes in pain intensity and disability status, on the development of chronic LBP. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective cohort data by merging data from three randomized trials (secondary analyses). PATIENT SAMPLE: Workers (n=628) on sick leave because of subacute nonspecific LBP. OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronic LBP for longer than 6 months (functional measure). METHODS: Potential prognostic variables were demographic, work, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics (self-report measures). We also included as prognostic variables a clinically relevant change in pain intensity and disability status. For the selection of variables and prognostic models, bootstrapping techniques were used in combination with multivariable logistic regression. The explained variance and discrimination were used to evaluate the clinical performance of the models. RESULTS: The variables most strongly related to chronic LBP were as follows: no clinically relevant change in pain intensity and in disability status in the first 3 months, a higher pain intensity score at baseline, and a higher score for kinesiophobia. This prognostic model had a bootstrap-corrected explained variance of 37\\% and a discriminative ability (c index) of 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical-, work-, and psychosocial-related variables contribute to the development of chronic LBP. The most promising variables are a clinically relevant decrease in pain intensity and in disability status in the first 3 months. These variables are relevant for clinicians to advise their patients with respect to preventive measures or treatment strategies.

In most resource poor countries, however, the required anthropometric data from purpose-designed growth surveys are not readily available. We propose a practical method for estimating regional (multi-country) age-conditional weight distributions based on existing survey data from different countries. We developed a two-step method by which one is able to model data with widely different age ranges and sample sizes. The method produces references both at the country level and at the regional (multi-country) level. The first step models country-specific centile curves by Box-Cox t and Box-Cox power exponential distributions implemented in generalized additive model for location, scale and shape through a common model. Individual countries may vary in location and spread. The second step defines the regional reference from a finite mixture of the country distributions, weighted by population size. To demonstrate the method we fitted the weight-for-age distribution of 12 countries in South East Asia and the Western Pacific, based on 273 270 observations. We modeled both the raw body weight and the corresponding Z score, and obtained a good fit between the final models and the original data for both solutions. We briefly discuss an application of the generated regional references to obtain appropriate, region specific, age-based dosing regimens of drugs used in the tropics. The method is an affordable and efficient strategy to estimate regional growth distributions where the standard costly alternatives are not an option.

Design: A cross sectional study of pregnant women and their babies. Data on maternal socioeconomic status and current pregnancy, including HIV status and newborn anthropometry, were collected. Malaria parasitaemia was assessed in maternal peripheral and placental blood, fetal haemoglobin was measured in cord blood, and maternal HIV status was determined. Setting: Two district hospitals in rural southern Malawi, between March 1993 and July 1994. Outcome variables: Newborn weight, length, Rohrer’s ponderal index. Results: Maternal HIV (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.76 (95\\% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.98)) and first pregnancy (AOR 1.83 (1.10 to 3.05)) were independently associated with low weight for age. Placental or peripheral parasifaemia at delivery (AOR 1.73 (1.02 to 2.88)) and primigravidae (AOR 2.13 (1.27 to 3.59)) were independently associated with low length for age. Maternal malaria at delivery and primiparity were associated with reduced newborn weight and length but not with disproportionate growth. Maternal HIV infection was associated only with reduced birth weight. The malaria and parity effect occurred throughout gestational weeks 30-40, but the HIV effect primarily after 38 weeks gestation. Conclusion: Fetal growth retardation in weight and length commonly occurs in this highly malarious area and is present from 30 weeks gestation. A maternal HIV effect on fetal weight occurred after 38 weeks gestation","tags":[],"title":"Anthropometry of fetal growth in rural Malawi in relation to maternal malaria and HIV status","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.M.

Objective: To describe growth patterns in infants with low and normal birthweight and determine maternal risk factors for infant undernutrition. Methods: Babies born in a rural district of southern Malawi were recruited. An infant cohort was selected on the basis of low or normal birthweight. Weight and length were recorded at birth and at 4-weekly intervals until at 52 weeks after birth. Maternal characteristics at first antenatal attendance and delivery were obtained. Odds ratios in univariate analysis were adjusted for birthweight. Factors included in the multivariate regression included maternal illiteracy, season of birth, maternal iron deficiency and number of infant illness episodes. Results: Low birthweight infants were shorter and lighter throughout infancy than either normal birthweight or international reference values. At 12 months, placental or peripheral malaria at delivery (adjusted odds 1.8; 1.0, 3.1), number of infant illness episodes (AOR = 2.1; 1.2, 3.6) and maternal illiteracy (AOR = 2.7; 1.5, 4.9) were independently associated with low weight for age. Maternal short stature (AOR = 1.8; 1.1. 3.2), male sex (AOR = 2.4; 1.4, 4.1), number of infant illness episodes (AOR = 2.6; 1.5, 4.4), and birth in the rainy season (2.1; 1.2, 3.7) were independently associated with stunting. Placental or peripheral malaria at delivery (AOR = 2.2; 1.1, 4.4) and number of illness episodes (AOR = 2.2; 1.1, 4.5) were independently associated with thinness. Conclusion: Malaria during pregnancy and maternal illiteracy are important maternal characteristics associated with infant undernutrition. Innovative health/literacy strategies are required to address malaria control in pregnancy in order to reduce the magnitude of its effects on infant undernutrition. ™ 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Reference curves for all pubertal stages were constructed. The 50th percentile of Tanner breast stage 2 was 10.7 y, and 50\\% of the boys had reached a testicular volume of 4 mL at 11.5 y of age. Median age at menarche was 13.15 y. The median age at which the various stages of pubertal development were observed has stabilized since 1980. The increase of the age at stage G2 between 1965 and 1997 is probably owing to different interpretations of its definition. The current age limits for the definition of precocious are close to the third percentile of these references. A high agreement was found between the pubic hair stages and stages of pubertal (genital and breast) development, but slightly more in boys than in girls. Menarcheal age was dependent on height, weight, and body mass index. At a given age tall or heavy girls have a higher probability of having menarche compared with short or thin girls. A body weight exceeding 60 kg (+1 SDS), or a body mass index of 20 (+1 SDS), has no or little effect on the chance of having menarche, whereas for height such a ceiling effect was not observed. In conclusion, in The Netherlands the age at onset of puberty or menarche has stabilized since 1980. Height, weight, and body mass index have a strong influence on the chance of menarche.

Multiple imputation is a statistically sound technique for handling incomplete data. Two problems should be addressed before the routine application of the technique becomes feasible. First, if imputations are to be appropriate for more than one statistical analysis, they should be generated independently of any scientific models that are to be applied to the data at a later stage. This is done by finding imputations that will extrapolate the structure of the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure. A second problem is to use complete-data methods in an efficient way. The HERMES workstation encapsulates existing statistical packages in a client-server model. It forms a natural and convenient environment for implementing multiple imputation Conference code: 21524 Cited By (since 1996): 6 Export Date: 1 September 2008 Source: Scopus CODEN: 00166 Language of Original Document: English Correspondence Address: van Buuren, S.; TNO-PG Leiden, Netherlands Sponsors: CESDIS; NASA; NOAA","tags":[],"title":"Routine multiple imputation in statistical databases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S. van Buuren","J.
